       The jury commission for each county shall compile and maintain a county jury list consisting of the current voter registration list for the county supplemented with names from other lists of persons resident therein, such as lists of utility customers, property taxpayers, motor vehicle registrations, drivers’ licenses, and state identification cards, which the supreme court from time to time designates. The supreme court shall initially designate the other lists within ninety (90) days following the effective date of this act and exercise the authority to designate from time to time in order to foster the policy and protect the rights secured by sections 2-202 and 2-203, Idaho Code.

        Where the defendant made no argument, nor did the record indicate, that the lack of participation by one member of the two-member jury commission in the preparation and compilation of the jury lists affected the random nature or objectivity of the selection process, the compilation of the jury lists by the one member unaided by the other member was valid since the defendant did not establish nor even argue that any prejudice resulted therefrom.

        In an appeal from convictions of burglary challenging the constitutionality of the jury selection process, where the evidence showed that Hispanics, who accounted for 8.2 percent of the county population, were underrepresented in the jury pool by an absolute disparity of five percent and were 61 percent less likely than the average members of the community to be called for jury service, such figures, taken together, were sufficient to show a lack of “fair and reasonable” representation, thereby imposing upon the state an obligation to justify the underrepresentation. However, the state met this burden by showing that the master jury list was derived from county lists of adult, licensed drivers and registered voters, since such source lists are commonly used and serve a significant state interest in maintaining an efficient, practical jury selection system. State v. Lopez, 107 Idaho 726, 692 P.2d 370 (Ct. App. 1984). Source of List.

        The 2013 amendment, by ch. 207, in subsection (5), updated the reference in the first sentence and rewrote the last sentence, which formerly read: “If the prospective juror fails to appear pursuant to the court’s order or fails to show good cause for his failure to appear as directed by the jury commission, he is guilty of contempt and upon conviction may be fined not more than three hundred dollars ($300) or imprisoned not more than three (3) days, or both, and postponed to a new prospective jury panel as set by the presiding judge”.

        Where the defendant made no argument, nor did the record indicate, that the lack of participation by one member of the two-member jury commission in the preparation and compilation of the jury lists affected the random nature or objectivity of the selection process, the compilation of the jury lists by the one member unaided by the other member was valid since the defendant did not establish nor even argue that any prejudice resulted therefrom. State v. Silcox, 103 Idaho 483, 650 P.2d 625 (1982), overruled on other grounds, State v. Flint, 114 Idaho 806, 761 P.2d 1158 (1988).

        Although the county made no follow-up contacts and persons who failed to return completed questionnaires were not placed on the quarterly jury list, in violation of this section, where the appellants made no showing that the commissioners’ failure to contact nonresponding potential jurors contributed to underrepresentation of Hispanics, an inference arose that an Hispanic person whose name appeared on the master jury list was as likely as the average person to return a completed juror qualification form.

        Idaho’s Uniform Jury Service and Selection Act (this chapter) does not preclude jury commissioners from delegating such ministerial duties as may be performed by a computer service; the use of computers has been recognized as beneficial to the goal of fair and impartial jury selection. Absent a showing that use of the computer service in any way adversely affected the random nature or objectivity of the jury selection process, no purported error by the jury commissioners would afford a basis to disturb the judgments of conviction.

        It would be patently unreasonable to require the state to utilize jurors who are not proficient in the English language, unable to understand testimony, directions of the court, or read exhibits and instructions; furthermore, it is not difficult to perceive that the state has a significant interest in the integrity of the jury system, and that that interest is manifestly and primarily advanced by limiting jurors to those who are capable of understanding the proceedings, and, as long as the qualification is equally administered as to all foreign language speakers, there is no constitutional infirmity in the requirement that jurors be competent in English.

       <p>
        This section requires that a motion challenging the composition of a jury be made within seven days after the discovery of grounds therefor and, in any event, before the jury is sworn to try the case; accordingly, where the defendant waited until the appeal of his conviction to make his first objection to the selection of the jury, the objection was untimely since the defendant did not use reasonable diligence in asserting his rights in the trial court.

        While a constitutional challenge to the jury selection process must focus upon systematic underrepresentation of an identifiable group, like Hispanics, no such requirement applies to a statutory challenge; a challenge under the Uniform Jury Selection and Service Act (§ 2-201 et seq.) may be based broadly upon a showing that the statutory violation has substantially affected the random nature and objectivity of the process.

If there are insufficient moneys to fully reimburse every county whose application is approved, then each county shall receive only a percentage of its reimbursement request.

       <p>
        The decision not to call a grand jury falls within the judge’s discretionary authority; such a decision will not be disturbed unless an abuse of discretion has occurred. Parsons v. Idaho State Tax Comm’n, 110 Idaho 572, 716 P.2d 1344 (Ct. App. 1986).

        The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant’s request for a grand jury where the court found the defendant’s claims against the state tax commission to be without merit, and the defendant did not make any showing that he was barred from the alternative remedy of presenting his evidence to the prosecutor or to the state attorney general’s office.

        Section 2-103 and this section require 16 men to constitute grand jury. Less number will not constitute legal body. State v. Roberts, 33 Idaho 30, 188 P. 895 (1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was the intention of the legislature (§ 2-502) that business of grand jury might be carried on without the presence of entire 16 members. Rich v. Varian, 36 Idaho 355, 210 P. 1011 (1922).

        Where a defendant was indicted for false pretenses by a grand jury of 16, he was not prejudiced by the act of the judge in dismissing three members of a grand jury, one because of illness, and two because of necessity of engaging in private employment, and appointing three additional individuals to the grand jury.

        Excusing some of the members of the grand jury and substituting others leaving a jury of 16 does not show prejudice; an accused is not entitled to a particular grand juror. State v. Dunn, 60 Idaho 568, 94 P.2d 779 (1939).
