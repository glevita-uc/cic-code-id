       There can be but one action for the recovery of any debt, or the enforcement of any right secured by mortgage upon real estate which action must be in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. In such action the court may, by its judgment, direct a sale of the incumbered property (or so much thereof as may be necessary) and the application of the proceeds of the sale to the payment of the costs of the court and the expenses of the sale, and the amount due to the plaintiff; and sales of real estate under judgments of foreclosure of mortgages and liens are subject to redemption as in the case of sales under execution; [and if it appear from the sheriff’s return that the proceeds are insufficient, and a balance still remains due, judgment can then be docketed for such balance against the defendant or defendants personally liable for the debt], and it becomes a lien on the real estate of such judgment debtor, as in other cases on which execution may be issued.

        Chattel mortgagee, foreclosing on cattle voluntarily surrendered, could not thereafter maintain a separate action in claim and delivery to recover cattle held by third party under agister’s lien. Portland Cattle Loan Co. v. Biehl, 42 Idaho 39, 245 P. 88 (1925).
       </p>

        A deficiency judgment on mortgage foreclosure determines that mortgage security has been exhausted and mortgagee cannot go behind such judgment in claim and delivery action and maintain that he is entitled to possession of property not disposed of by foreclosure sale.

       <p>
        Claim and delivery is not “one action” to foreclose mortgage and it may be maintained against stranger for possession of mortgaged chattel, where mortgage entitles mortgagee to possession. Forbush v. San Diego Fruit & Produce Co., 46 Idaho 231, 266 P. 659 (1928).
    Where a claim and delivery action for possession of property sold under a conditional sale contract was held, on appeal, not maintainable because title to the property vested in the vendee by the vendee’s subsequent mortgage to the vendor, cause was remanded to allow plaintiff to amend his complaint and convert action into one of foreclosure. Birkeland v. Clearwater Concentrating Co., 64 Idaho 122, 127 P.2d 1047 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claim and delivery action for possession of machinery sold on a conditional sales contract was not maintainable, where such machinery was subsequently mortgaged by the vendee to the vendor, since the taking of the mortgage vested title in the vendee, and the only method of enforcing any right secured by the mortgage was by a foreclosure proceeding.

        With reference to its application to enforcement of claim against decedent’s estate, filing of claim with administrator is not action within meaning of section, and gives to claimant no right of action, but leaves selling of property and payment of debts to discretion of administrator in manner prescribed by law. Kendrick State Bank v. Barnum, 31 Idaho 562, 173 P. 1144 (1918); Berry v. Scott, 43 Idaho 789, 255 P. 305 (1927).

       <p>
        A petition by the holder of a mortgage upon real estate to require the administrator of the deceased mortgagor’s estate to sell the mortgaged property “to secure the just rights or interests of the creditors” is not a proceeding to foreclose the mortgage.

       </p>
       <p>
        A mortgagor, sued in ejectment but claiming his deed absolute in form to mortgagee was in fact a mortgage, need not tender the amount of the debt in making such claim where the debt was not yet due. Dickens v. Heston, 53 Idaho 91, 21 P.2d 905 (1933).

        Action to foreclose mortgage given to secure several notes is a separate and distinct action, and but one fee can be allowed in such action; if such fee is stipulated by mortgage to be reasonable, the court has no authority to allow a larger sum.

        To entitle plaintiff in foreclosure proceeding to recover attorney’s fees, where same have been stipulated for in mortgage, plaintiff must tender evidence upon two propositions: First, that plaintiff has agreed to pay his counsel a fixed or reasonable sum for his services; second, reasonableness of the fee.

        A mortgagee was not precluded from suing to collect the entire debt secured by a mortgage where the debt was not due and where there was no basis to foreclose the mortgage at the time the property was sold to a third party by the trustee of prior deeds of trust for less than the fair market value of the property.

        A trust deed executed to secure a given debt, payable at a specific time, is a mortgage and cannot be foreclosed by notice and sale under a power contained in the deed, but only by proceedings under this section. Brown v. Bryan, 5 Idaho 145, 51 P. 995 (1896).

        In determining whether a deed, absolute in form, was intended as a mortgage, it is proper to consider previous negotiations of the parties, their agreements, conversations and course of dealings and the value of the property may likewise be considered, together with the necessitous condition of mortgagor in connection with the inadequacy of the consideration.

        An instrument absolutely conveying realty stands as the clearly ascertained intention of the parties, which must be enforced unless it is shown by convincing evidence that the instrument, as delivered and accepted, was under a different mutual intention;, and, where one seeks to prove that an instrument which purports on its face to be an absolute conveyance of title is in fact a mortgage, he must do so by clear, satisfactory and convincing proof.

       <p>
        A grantor seeking to show that an absolute conveyance is not what it naturally purports to be has the burden of making strict proof of that fact, and slight and indefinite evidence should not be permitted to change the character of the transaction given the form of a bargain and sale.

        This section requires that there can be but one action for the recovery of any debt or enforcement of any right secured by mortgage and requires the creditor to proceed for the collection of his debt against the property and to exhaust the security thereof before being allowed to acquire personal judgment against the debtor; and it was intended not to allow the creditor to hold an encumbrance on his debtor’s property and at the same time proceed against him for a personal judgment, either with or without attachment.

        A decree of foreclosure, originally or after return of sale, must determine who is personally liable for the debt, and without such adjudication, there is no legal basis for a deficiency judgment; a recital in a decree of foreclosure that there is a certain sum owing and unpaid to plaintiff from defendants and ordering a foreclosure of the mortgage is insufficient to justify a deficiency judgment.

        A foreclosure decree which recited that if the mortgaged premises failed to bring a sufficient amount on a sheriff’s sale to discharge the mortgage debt with costs and expenses of sale, a deficiency judgment should be docketed in conformity with the law and practice of the court was an insufficient determination of a personal liability to warrant an entry of a deficiency judgment.

        This section authorizes a single form of action to collect a debt secured by a mortgage; the mortgage must be foreclosed.

        The legislative policies underlying the mortgage foreclosure statutes should guide the court’s exercise of its equitable powers when enforcing a vendor’s lien; therefore, protections paralleling those given mortgagors are appropriate and may be provided in equity, where sellers of real property assert the existence of vendor’s liens.

        Writ of assistance is the appropriate remedy to place in possession the purchaser at a foreclosure sale and may be issued against any and all persons concluded by such judgment. Harding v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The power to issue a writ of assistance has always been exercised by courts of equity to place a purchaser of mortgaged premises in possession, after a decree of foreclosure, the expiration of the period of redemption, and the execution and delivery of the sheriff’s deed, where the possession is withheld by any party bound by the decree. Williams v. Sherman, 35 Idaho 169, 205 P. 259 (1922); Eagle Rock Corp. v. Idamont Hotel Co., 60 Idaho 639, 95 P.2d 838 (1939).

        A mortgagee was not precluded from suing to collect the entire debt secured by a mortgage where the debt was not due and where there was no basis to foreclose the mortgage at the time the property was sold to a third party by the trustee of prior deeds of trust for less than the fair market value of the property. Idaho Power Co. v. Benj. Houseman Co., 123 Idaho 674, 851 P.2d 970 (1993).

       <p>
        If the fair market value of the mortgaged property is greater than the amount expended by a purchaser at the foreclosure sale (including amounts paid to redeem from prior mortgages) then fair market value will be used to compute the amount of the deficiency; if the total price paid to acquire the property is greater than its fair market value, the cost of acquisition will be used to compute any deficiency. Thompson v. Kirsch, 106 Idaho 177, 677 P.2d 490 (Ct. App. 1984).
    The fact that foreclosure decree fixes the amount of mortgage indebtedness does not preclude the decree from setting forth a per diem amount of interest which will accrue from the date of the decree to date of sale and does not preclude adding costs of the foreclosure sale in computing the amount of any deficiency judgment. Thompson v. Kirsch, 106 Idaho 177, 677 P.2d 490 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where beneficiaries of deed of trust opted for judicial foreclosure, rather than foreclosure by advertisement and sale, the court properly determined the amount of the deficiency judgment by proceeding under this section, rather than under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.45.html#t45c15s45-1512" target="_blank">§ 45-1512</a></cite>. Thompson v. Kirsch, 106 Idaho 177, 677 P.2d 490 (Ct. App. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The correct date for determining the value of real property was the date when the trial court in a foreclosure case determined whether a deficiency judgment should be entered pursuant to this section. Isaak v. Idaho First Nat’l Bank, 119 Idaho 907, 811 P.2d 832 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        In foreclosure actions, a mortgagee may obtain a deficiency judgment if a foreclosure sale does not satisfy a mortgagor’s debt. The deficiency is limited by this section to the difference between the fair market value of the property and the amount of the unpaid debt. Wash. Fed. v. Hulsey, 162 Idaho 742, 405 P.3d 1 (2017).

        The adoption of S.L. 1937, ch. 190, repealing S.L. 1937, ch. 31, which prohibited any court from entering a deficiency judgment, left S.L. 1933, ch. 150, this section, in full force and effect, and the court had the right to enter a deficiency judgment against defendant in a mortgage foreclosure action. Brown v. Deck, 65 Idaho 710, 152 P.2d 587 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence in the record existed for the district court to calculate the deficiency where the district court noted that the farm owners admitted that they owed the obligation evidenced by the land contract and promissory note and that the property owners could proceed with the foreclosure on the farm property; following the sale, the proceeds would be applied to the judgment on the promissory notes. Elliott v. Darwin Neibaur Farms, 138 Idaho 774, 69 P.3d 1035, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1004, 124 S. Ct. 535, 157 L. Ed. 2d 410 (2003).

        Where the “reasonable value” of the property, as found by the district judge, was the difference between the fair market value and the amount owing on the first deed of trust and the bid by holders of second deed of trust at the sheriff’s sale matched the fair market value, less the amount owing on the first deed of trust, the credit allowed to cosigners of second deed against the mortgage indebtedness secured by the second deed of trust was equal to the property’s “reasonable value” and holders of second deed were entitled to a deficiency judgment.

        Any expenses paid after foreclosure decree could not be considered as part of the mortgage indebtedness and expenses could only be considered in computing deficiency judgment if they were bona fide costs of the foreclosure sale. Thompson v. Kirsch, 106 Idaho 177, 677 P.2d 490 (Ct. App. 1984).
    The district judge erred by including in the mortgage indebtedness those payments and advances made by the holders of second deed of trust after the entry of the decree of foreclosure; this section requires the court to determine the amount of the mortgage indebtedness in the decree of foreclosure and the decree of foreclosure provides the cut off date for fixing the amount of the mortgage indebtedness. Thompson v. Kirsch, 106 Idaho 177, 677 P.2d 490 (Ct. App. 1984).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the amount of a senior mortgagee’s lien is less than the judicially determined fair market value of the property, the junior lienholder should be required either to redeem to protect its security or to give credit to the debtor against any deficiency judgment for the difference between the amount realized by the senior mortgagee on the foreclosure sale and the judicially determined fair market value of the property as of the date the junior’s redemption right expired. First Sec. Bank v. Stauffer, 112 Idaho 133, 730 P.2d 1053 (Ct. App. 1986).

        Section 6-101 authorizes a single form of action to collect a debt secured by a mortgage; the mortgage must be foreclosed. A deficiency judgment may be obtained if the foreclosure sale does not satisfy the debt; but the deficiency is limited to the difference between the fair market value of the real property and the amount of the unpaid debt. The creditor may not simply sue on the debt and collect by execution on the judgment. Quintana v. Anthony, 109 Idaho 977, 712 P.2d 678 (Ct. App. 1985).

        Where the fair market value of a farm upon which defendants discontinued making mortgage payments exceeded both the first and second mortgages and the defendants had a legal right to insist the plaintiffs first look to their security for payment on the note, and where the defendants had the right to claim the protection of this section which prohibits a deficiency judgment if the value of the security is equal to or exceeds the mortgage indebtedness, by insisting on a nonrecourse note and a release of individual liability, the defendants obtained no greater rights than they had by statute under the circumstances then existing, and their insistence on retaining these rights could not form the basis of a claim of economic duress.

        The legislative intent in adopting this section was to require, as a prerequisite to an award of treble damages, a finding that the waste was wilfully, wantonly or maliciously committed. Pearson v. Harper, 87 Idaho 245, 392 P.2d 687 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for waste where the lessor claimed in its complaint that personal property was missing from the leased premises and that it was trying to recover for the waste that had occurred up to the time of trial, these claims were not premature since the facts giving rise to them had already occurred; thus, the trial court’s dismissal of the waste claim as premature was incorrect. Consolidated AG of Curry, Inc. v. Rangen, Inc., 128 Idaho 228, 912 P.2d 115 (1996).

       <p>
        Where lessee was not farming the leased real property in a good and farmer-like manner as he covenanted in the lease to do, he was committing waste, and the lessor could seek injunctive relief as well as damages. Olson v. Bedke, 97 Idaho 825, 555 P.2d 156 (1976). Specific Finding.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was questionable whether court’s legal conclusion as to waste constituted a specific finding of wilful, wanton or malicious conduct on the defendant’s part, but, as defendant did not assign error to the court’s failure to make such a specific finding and there was substantial, competent evidence establishing waste, award was upheld. Watts v. Krebs, 131 Idaho 616, 962 P.2d 387 (1998).

       <p>
        Finding in favor of the lessee in a contract dispute action was appropriate because the lessor’s waste claim failed since the lessee did not unreasonably injure a deposit. Although the mining of the deposit was not generating the profit that the lessor had desired or hoped for, it nonetheless was the activity contemplated by the contract. Independence Lead Mines Co. v. Hecla Mining Co., 143 Idaho 22, 137 P.3d 409 (2006).

        Defendant did not dispute that he harvested more than his half share of the timber without the knowledge and consent of his cotenant; therefore, the district court correctly concluded that he committed waste. Watts v. Krebs, 131 Idaho 616, 962 P.2d 387 (1998).

        Section 1 of S.L. 2013, ch. 62 provided: “Legislative Intent. The Legislature finds that generally, real and personal property damage caused by forest and range fire is measured by the diminution of fair market value of the real and personal property. In Idaho, restoration damages may be awarded if there is a reason personal to the owner for restoring the forest or range land to its original condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        “The Legislature further finds that in other jurisdictions, large forest or range land owners have sought and have been awarded double recovery, the diminution of fair market value and restoration costs, for the damage to forest or range land caused by forest or range fires. The awards include intangible environmental damages that are clearly speculative in their nature, and should not be recoverable. This legislation clarifies that for real and personal property damage caused by forest or range fire, recovery is limited to reasonable suppression costs, economic damages and either the diminution of fair market value of the real and personal property, or the actual and tangible costs for restoration, not intangible environmental damages, as a result of the forest or range fire.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 1 of S.L. 2018, ch. 350 provided: “Legislative intent. The Legislature of the State of Idaho makes the following findings and declares the following statement of intent and legislative purpose:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Under Section 1, Article I, of the Constitution of the State of Idaho, ‘acquiring, possessing and protecting property’ is an inalienable right. The right to own real property and to exclude others from that property according to law is fundamental to our rights as citizens and has been upheld repeatedly by the United States Supreme Court.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) Section 23, Article I of the Idaho Constitution also protects the right to hunt and fish, but that right expressly does not include ‘a right to trespass on private property.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) The Legislature finds that trespassing on private property has become a serious problem for landowners throughout the state. While many individuals respect private property rights, landowners report a significant number of persons who blatantly disregard the rights of property owners and frequently cause damage to private property, including cut fences, ruined crops, vandalism and theft.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) The trespass laws of the State of Idaho have been insufficient to deter trespassing and have offered inadequate penalties when trespassers are prosecuted.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) Moreover, the existing trespass laws are a confusing, inconsistent and constitutionally suspect patchwork of laws. They impose significant posting burdens on landowners, without reducing trespassing. The poor construction of the laws of trespass hinders the effective arrest and prosecution of trespassers.

       <p>
        In an action for timber trespass, the measure of actual damages is based upon the amount of trees taken and the market value of the trees in that area at the time of the taking. Bumgarner v. Bumgarner, 124 Idaho 629, 862 P.2d 321 (Ct. App. 1993).

        This section applies only where the trespass is shown to have been wilfully and intentionally committed. United States v. Chamberlain, 51 F. Supp. 54 (D. Idaho 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c02s6-202A" target="_blank">§ 6-202A</a></cite> [now repealed], governing trespass, only apply when the trespass is shown to have been wilful and intentional, and the wronged party seeks treble damages therefor; in all other circumstances, the common law principles relating to trespass actions apply. Mock v. Potlatch Corp., 786 F. Supp. 1545 (D. Idaho 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Buyer of the parcel admitted to intentionally logging the sellers’ property, relying on his argument that the deed, which included an ambiguous easement, granted him the right to the timber. Sells v. Robinson, 141 Idaho 767, 118 P.3d 99 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support finding of timber trespass, where woman had her son-in-law enter a neighbor’s yard and cut 4 to 6 feet off of multiple arborvitaes. Greenfield v. Wurmlinger, 158 Idaho 591, 349 P.3d 1182 (2015).
    While this section does not so state in terms, it is clear that it is not intended to apply to cases in which the trespass was committed through an innocent mistake as to the boundary or location of a tract of land claimed by the defendant. Fischer v. Croston, 163 Idaho 331, 413 P.3d 731 (2018).

        Award of Fees.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although this section does not expressly provide for fee awards on appeal, neither does it restrict an award, and in this case the prevailing plaintiff was entitled, under this section, to an award of fees on appeal. Bubak v. Evans, 117 Idaho 510, 788 P.2d 1333 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney fees should not be apportioned based upon prevailing theories of recovery, but rather should be awarded based upon application of appropriate standards and factors. Bubak v. Evans, 117 Idaho 510, 788 P.2d 1333 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section mandates the award of a reasonable attorney fee to a plaintiff who prevails in an action brought hereunder, and the amount of the award is to be determined through consideration of the factors articulated in Idaho R. Civ. P. 54(e)(3). Bubak v. Evans, 117 Idaho 510, 788 P.2d 1333 (Ct. App. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Award allocating one-half of all plaintiff’s attorney fees to the prosecution of successful trespass claim was within the boundaries of court’s discretion. Bumgarner v. Bumgarner, 124 Idaho 629, 862 P.2d 321 (Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In trespass case, reviewing court declined to award the owners attorney fees on appeal because the neighbors had raised valid issues necessitating remand to the district court. Akers v. D. L. White Constr., Inc., 142 Idaho 293, 127 P.3d 196 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an easement dispute, attorney’s fees were improperly awarded because the owner was unable to collect treble damages due to a failure to post “No Trespassing” signs and a failure to prove damages for lost timber. Ransom v. Topaz Mktg., L.P., 143 Idaho 641, 152 P.3d 2 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an award of attorney fees under this section, the district court must apportion its award to cover only those attorney fees directly related to the trespass, where the case involves multiple issues. Akers v. Mortensen, 156 Idaho 27, 320 P.3d 418 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly granted attorney fees to property owners for trespass, because the owners were entitled to a reasonable attorney fee for prosecuting the trespass action. The district court limited the award of attorney fees to the trespass issue, noting the primary claim was to quiet title, and the trespass claim was only incidental to that primary claim. Fischer v. Croston, 163 Idaho 331, 413 P.3d 731 (2018).

        Fact that party prays in his complaint for treble damages under this section, and before trial waives his demand that damages be trebled, does not preclude him from recovering judgment for actual damages or entitle defendant to a non-suit. Gumaer v. White Pine Lumber Co., 11 Idaho 591, 83 P. 771 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        If plaintiff alleges facts constituting common-law action for cutting and removing timber, but amends, pleading same facts and claiming treble damages under this section, the amendment does not constitute new cause of action for the statute authorizing treble damages in no way affects cause of action, but merely goes to the relief to be granted.

        Action to recover treble damages under this section where it is not alleged that damage was committed wilfully or intentionally does not come within purview of said section, but is good as action at common law which may entitle plaintiff to recover his actual damages. Menasha Woodenware Co. v. Spokane Int’l R.R., 19 Idaho 586, 115 P. 22 (1911). Elements of Damage Claim.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two essential elements of plaintiff’s claim for damages, i.e., first, the actual amount of timber claimed to have been taken, and secondly, the market value of the timber in that area at the time of the alleged taking, were not established in plaintiff’s action praying for treble damages for a timber trespass.

       </p>
       <p>
        For a plaintiff to be entitled to recover statutory treble damages, instead of merely his actual damages, it is necessary to establish the trespass was wilfully and intentionally committed. Earl v. Fordice, 84 Idaho 542, 374 P.2d 713 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        With respect to trespasses on plaintiff’s land, the court concluded that defendant had believed he owned the portion of land in question and that his invasion of plaintiff’s property rights was, therefore, not wilful and intentional, but merely negligent; consequently, the court declined to award treble damages for the trespasses involving that portion of property.

        The court granted damages for treble the value of the trees that defendant had intentionally and wilfully removed from adjoining landowner’s lot; however, this award of statutory damages for the act of taking trees did not prevent the trial court from awarding punitive damages for defendant’s conduct in also constructing a road on adjoining landowner’s property. Bumgarner v. Bumgarner, 124 Idaho 629, 862 P.2d 321 (Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        When appellant landowners committed timber trespass on respondent neighbors’ property by entering the property and cutting down trees during the pendency of litigation involving a boundary dispute and an action to quiet title, appellants acted willfully and intentionally; therefore, this section’s trebling of damages applied to the trespass claim. Weitz v. Green, 148 Idaho 851, 230 P.3d 743 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Easement owners’ compensatory damage award in an action for trespass was properly trebled, because, although the owners had posted “No Trespassing” signs on the property, neighbors continued to use the disputed easement, removed the owners’ gates, and excavated the property. Akers v. D.L. White Constr., Inc., 156 Idaho 37, 320 P.3d 428 (2014).

        Section 1 of S.L. 2018, ch. 350 provided: “Legislative intent. The Legislature of the State of Idaho makes the following findings and declares the following statement of intent and legislative purpose:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Under Section 1, Article I, of the Constitution of the State of Idaho, ‘acquiring, possessing and protecting property’ is an inalienable right. The right to own real property and to exclude others from that property according to law is fundamental to our rights as citizens and has been upheld repeatedly by the United States Supreme Court.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) Section 23, Article I of the Idaho Constitution also protects the right to hunt and fish, but that right expressly does not include ‘a right to trespass on private property.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) The Legislature finds that trespassing on private property has become a serious problem for landowners throughout the state. While many individuals respect private property rights, landowners report a significant number of persons who blatantly disregard the rights of property owners and frequently cause damage to private property, including cut fences, ruined crops, vandalism and theft.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) The trespass laws of the State of Idaho have been insufficient to deter trespassing and have offered inadequate penalties when trespassers are prosecuted.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) Moreover, the existing trespass laws are a confusing, inconsistent and constitutionally suspect patchwork of laws. They impose significant posting burdens on landowners, without reducing trespassing. The poor construction of the laws of trespass hinders the effective arrest and prosecution of trespassers.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) It is the intent of the Legislature in passing this act to cultivate a new culture of respect for private property rights and a renewal of the neighborly ways that have been a hallmark of our state.”

        The effect of this section is to prohibit imposing vicarious liability upon the parents for a child’s negligent conduct. Fuller v. Studer, 122 Idaho 251, 833 P.2d 109 (1992).

        Parents’ Duty.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A parent who has knowledge of a minor child’s propensity for a particular type of harmful conduct is under an affirmative duty to guard against the foreseeable consequences of that specific propensity. Thus, this duty requires a two-step analysis. First, the court must look to see whether a parent has knowledge of a minor child’s propensity or proclivity for a specific harmful conduct. If the first step is answered affirmatively, then it must be determined whether the parent took reasonable steps to guard against the foreseeable consequences of the minor child’s propensity for the specific harmful conduct. Fuller v. Studer, 122 Idaho 251, 833 P.2d 109 (1992).

        Where plaintiff’s damages exceeded the limits under state law for recovery from a juvenile’s parents in a civil action, the liability of the parents for payment of a restitution award did not constitute a fine, penalty, or forfeiture. Mabey v. Ellis, 224 Bankr. 786 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1998).

      § 6-303. Unlawful detainer defined.
     </h3>
     <p>
      A tenant of real property, for a term less than life, is guilty of an unlawful detainer:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t06c03s6-303ol11">
       When he continues in possession, in person or by subtenant, of the property, or any part thereof, after the expiration of the term for which it is let to him, without the permission of his landlord, or the successor in estate of his landlord, if any there be; but in case of a tenancy at will, it must first be terminated by notice, as prescribed in the civil code.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c03s6-303ol12">
       Where he continues in possession, in person or by subtenant, without permission of his landlord, or the successor in estate of his landlord, if any there be, after default in the payment of rent, pursuant to the lease or agreement under which the property is held, and three (3) days’ notice, in writing, requiring its payment, stating the amount which is due, or possession of the property, shall have been served upon him, and if there be a subtenant in actual occupation of the premises, also upon such subtenant. Such notice shall also notify the tenant that if a court enters judgment against him, then he will have seventy-two (72) hours, if he is a residential tenant, and seven (7) days, or longer if granted by the court, if he is a commercial tenant or a tenant with a tract of land five (5) acres or more, to remove his belongings from the premises before the landlord may remove and dispose of such property pursuant to section 6-316, Idaho Code. Such notice may be served at any time within one (1) year after the rent becomes due. In all cases of tenancy upon agricultural lands, where the tenant has held over and retained possession for more than sixty (60) days after the expiration of his term without any demand of possession or notice to quit by the landlord, or the successor in estate of his landlord, if any there be, he shall be deemed to be holding by permission of the landlord, or the successor in estate of his landlord, if any there be, and shall be entitled to hold under the terms of the lease for another full year, and shall not be guilty of an unlawful detainer during said year, and such holding over for the period aforesaid shall be taken and construed as a consent on the part of a tenant to hold for another year.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c03s6-303ol13">
       Where he continues in possession in person, or by subtenants, after a neglect or failure to perform other conditions or covenants of the lease or agreement under which the property is held, including any covenant not to assign or sublet, than the one for payment of rent, and three (3) days’ notice, in writing, requiring the performance of such conditions or covenants, or the possession of the property, shall have been served upon him, and if there be a subtenant in actual occupation of the premises, also upon such subtenant. Within three (3) days after the service of the notice, the tenant, or any subtenant in actual occupation of the premises, or any mortgagee of the term, or other person interested in its continuance, may perform the conditions or covenants of the lease, or pay the stipulated rent, as the case may be, and thereby save the lease from forfeiture: provided, if the covenants and conditions of the lease, violated by the lessee, cannot afterward be performed, then no notice, as last prescribed herein, need be given to said lessee or his subtenant demanding the performance of the violated covenant or conditions of the lease. A tenant may take proceedings similar to those prescribed in this chapter, to obtain possession of premises let to an undertenant, in case of his unlawful detention of the premises underlet to him.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c03s6-303ol14">
       A tenant or subtenant, assigning or subletting, or committing waste upon, the demised premises contrary to the covenants of his lease, thereby terminates the lease, and the landlord, or his successor in estate, shall, upon service of three (3) days’ notice to quit upon the person or persons in possession, be entitled to restitution of possession of such demised premises under the provisions of this chapter.
    5. If any person is, or has been, engaged in the unlawful delivery, production or use of a controlled substance on the premises of the leased property during the term for which the premises are let to the tenant. For purposes of this chapter, the terms “delivery,” “production,” and “controlled substance” shall be defined as set forth in section 37-2701, Idaho Code.

        Where a tenant under a farm lease was late in paying his rent and the landlord, without demanding timely payment or giving any notice to the tenant, reentered the property, the failure to make a timely rental payment did not work a forfeiture and the tenant retained his rights under the lease including his option to purchase.

        Fact that lease was to expire in two years if plaintiff failed to sub-lease to defendants, shows that extension agreement between landlord and plaintiff for five years was made expressly for defendant’s benefit, and that possession by it during the remaining months of the extended term, was not such possession as to be drawn within the purview of this section. Knight v. Fox Caldwell Theatres Corp., 70 Idaho 148, 212 P.2d 1027 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        As long as a tenant remains in possession of premises and holds over term provided by the lease, which also provides for payment of a fixed sum for each day of holding over, he is still within the purview of the statute allowing him to remove his property “any time during the continuance of his term.” Pearson v. Harper, 87 Idaho 245, 392 P.2d 687 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision in lease requiring payment of $10.00 per day during the time possession is withheld following default and 30 day notice is indicative of tenant’s intent upon holding over; therefore, even though terms of the lease had expired, his possession was not more than a continuance of the original term, and tenant was entitled to remove trade fixtures which had not become an integral part of the premises and which could be removed without injury to the premises. Pearson v. Harper, 87 Idaho 245, 392 P.2d 687 (1964).

       <p>
        Where lease contract contained a clause that the lessors had the right to sell and the lessees had first option to buy during the tenancy and, if lessees failed to exercise the option, the sale of the property would automatically terminate the lease, the lessees were liable for unlawful detainer when they refused to quit the property after demand of possession, notice to quit, and the sale of the property to a third person by the lessors.

        A lessor’s contractual right to forfeiture must be clearly stipulated in order to be enforceable but, even absent a contractual forfeiture remedy, the statutory remedy is still available in an unlawful detainer action; absent a clear contractual right to declare forfeiture, a landlord may not, without the express consent of a tenant, repossess his property without resorting to remedies provided in the unlawful detainer statutes.

        The parties to a real estate lease are entitled to negotiate default, termination and notice provisions affording the tenant greater protection than those prescribed by this section and, when the parties agree to such provisions, their agreement is binding; thus, landlords’ failure to comply with the 30-day notice provision of the lease before evicting tenant was not excused by subdivision 4. of this section.

        A continuing course of conduct by a lessor which misleads a lessee to his prejudice in regard to the lessor’s intent to strictly enforce the terms of the lease may constitute a waiver. However, a lessor should certainly not be precluded from terminating a lease for the late payment of rent or other obligation simply because he has been lenient on prior occasions in accepting late rent.

        Acceptance of rent accruing subsequent to a breach is a well recognized form of conduct which may establish a lessor’s intent to waive a breach of a lease agreement. However, where the lessor takes definite action to terminate the lease by sending notice of termination and, thereafter, proceeds within a reasonable time to regain possession of the premises, but nevertheless also accepts rent subsequent to the notice of termination, the intent of the lessor to waive the breach by his acceptance of rent is far from clear.

      No person other than the tenant of the premises, and subtenant, if there be one, in the actual occupation of the premises when the notice herein provided for was served, need be made parties defendant in the proceeding, nor shall any proceeding abate nor the plaintiff be nonsuited for the nonjoinder of any persons who might have been made parties defendant; but when it appears that any of the parties served with process or appearing in the proceeding are guilty of the offense charged, judgment must be rendered against them. Any person who shall become a subtenant of the premises or any part thereof after the service of notice as provided in this chapter shall be bound by the judgment. In case a married woman be a tenant or a subtenant, her coverture shall constitute no defense; but in case her husband be not joined, or unless she be doing business as a sole trader, an execution issued upon a personal judgment against her can only be enforced against property on the premises at the commencement of the action.

     <p>
      In an action for damages incurred as a result of failure to pay rent or damages as a result of the unlawful production of a controlled substance on the leased premises during the term for which the premises are let to the tenant, the plaintiff in his complaint must set forth the facts on which he seeks to recover. If the plaintiff combines his action for damages with an action for possession, the complaint shall also describe the premises with reasonable certainty and may set forth therein any circumstances which may have accompanied the alleged nonpayment of rent or the facts which are the basis for the landlord’s reasonable grounds to believe that a person is, or has been, engaged in the unlawful production of a controlled substance on the leased premises during the term for which the premises are let to the tenant, and claim damages therefor; provided, however, that the early trial provision of section 6-310, Idaho Code, shall not be applicable when an action for damages is combined with an action for possession. In an action for damages, a summons must be issued returnable as in other cases upon filing the complaint.

The jury, or the court, if the proceeding be tried without a jury, shall also assess the damages occasioned to the plaintiff by any forcible entry, or by any forcible or unlawful detainer, alleged in the complaint and proved on the trial, and find the amount of any rent due, if the alleged unlawful detainer be after default in the payment of rent or, after default, based upon a finding that a landlord had reasonable grounds to believe that a person is, or has been, engaged in the unlawful distribution, production, or use of a controlled substance on the leased premises during the term for which the premises are let to the tenant, and the judgment shall be rendered against the defendant guilty of the forcible entry, or forcible or unlawful detainer, for the amount of the damages thus assessed, and of the rent found due. When the proceeding is for an unlawful detainer after default in payment of rent where the tract of land is larger than five (5) acres, and the lease or agreement under which the rent is payable has not by its terms expired, execution upon the judgment shall not be issued until the expiration of five (5) days after the entry of the judgment, within which time the tenant, or any subtenant, or any mortgagee of the term, or other party interested in its continuance, may pay into court, for the landlord, the amount found due as rent, with interest thereon, and the amount of the damages found by the jury or the court for the unlawful detainer, and the costs of the proceeding, and thereupon the judgment shall be satisfied and the tenant be restored to his estate; but if payment as here provided be not made within the five (5) days, the judgment may be enforced for its full amount, and for the possession of the premises.

        Fact that lease was to expire in two years if plaintiff failed to sub-lease to defendants, shows that extension agreement between landlord and plaintiff for five years was made expressly for defendant’s benefit, and that possession by defendant during the remaining months of the extended term precludes plaintiff from resorting to remedy prescribed by this section.

        A lessor’s contractual right to forfeiture must be clearly stipulated in order to be enforceable but, even absent a contractual forfeiture remedy, the statutory remedy is still available in an unlawful detainer action; absent a clear contractual right to declare forfeiture, a landlord may not, without the express consent of a tenant, repossess his property without resorting to remedies provided in the unlawful detainer statutes.

        Trial court’s finding that tenant stayed in possession for 18 days after expiration of the lease, without consent, express or implied, was insufficient to justify award of treble damages; and, on remand, trial court will find whether the intent or motives of tenant disclosed malice, wantonness or oppression during time they held over, then enter conclusions of law and judgment to conform to such findings.

        Since a counter cross-claim was improper in an unlawful detainer action filed by a gas company against a bulk distributor operator to recover possession of a bulk plant, dismissal of the operator’s counterclaim alleging that gas company’s action in terminating distributor and consignment agreements interfered with operator’s right to freely sell his business, rather than severance for separate trial as operator requested, was proper.

         Failure to install approved smoke detectors in each dwelling unit, to include mobile homes, under the landlord’s control. Upon commencement of a rental agreement, the landlord shall verify that smoke detectors have been installed and are in good working order in the dwelling unit. The tenant shall maintain the smoke detectors in good working order during the tenant’s rental period. For purposes of this section, an approved smoke detector is a battery-operated device that is capable of detecting visible or invisible particles of combustion and that bears a label or other identification issued by an approved testing agency having a service for inspection of materials and workmanship at the factory during fabrication and assembly. If the landlord or the landlord’s assignee fails to install working smoke detectors, the tenant may send written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the landlord or the landlord’s assignee that if working smoke detectors are not installed within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt of the letter, the tenant may install smoke detectors and deduct the cost from the tenant’s next month’s rent. Smoke detectors purchased by the tenant and deducted from rent become the property of the landlord and shall not be removed from the premises.

      <li id="t06c03s6-320ol1c">
       If, upon the trial, the verdict of the jury, or, if the case be tried without a jury, the finding of the court, be in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant, judgment shall be entered for the amount of the damages assessed. Judgment may also be entered requiring specific performance for any breach of agreement showing by the evidence, and for costs and disbursements.

      <li id="t06c03s6-320ol1d">
       Before a tenant shall have standing to file an action under this section, he must give his landlord three (3) days written notice, listing each failure or breach upon which his action will be premised and written demand requiring performance or cure. If, within three (3) days after service of the notice, any listed failure or breach has not been performed or cured by the landlord, the tenant may proceed to commence an action for damages and specific performance.
    (e) The provisions of this section shall not apply to tracts of land of five (5) acres or more used for agricultural purposes.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Upon filing the complaint, a summons must be issued, served and returned as in other actions, provided, however, that in an action exclusively for specific performance, at the time of issuance of the summons, the court shall schedule a trial within twelve (12) days from the filing of the complaint, and the service of the summons, complaint and trial setting on the defendant shall be not less than five (5) days before the day of trial appointed by the court. If the plaintiff brings an action for damages under this section, or combines his action for damages with an action for specific performance, the early trial provision of this section shall not be applicable, and a summons must be issued returnable as in other cases upon filing the complaint.

        In adopting the reasonable care standard for landlords in
    Stephens v. Stearns
    , 106 Idaho 249, 678 P.2d 41 (1984), the Idaho supreme court noted that its holding was supported by a statutory version of the implied warranty of habitability. Stevens v. Fleming, 116 Idaho 523, 777 P.2d 1196 (1989).
    Court erred in instructing jury that, under implied warranty of habitability statute, the jury needed to find that the landlord was negligent in order for the tenant to collect damages for a noxious odor caused by maintenance of the building. Silver Creek Computers, Inc. v. Petra, Inc., 136 Idaho 879, 42 P.3d 672 (2002).
       </p>

        The supreme court would not expand the common law by imposing an implied obligation on the part of a landlord to keep the premises in a habitable state of repair, where the legislature had already acted in the same area by enacting this statutory version of the implied warranty of habitability theory. Worden v. Ordway, 105 Idaho 719, 672 P.2d 1049 (1983).

        Where a landlord wrongfully locks a tenant out of the premises, a tenant would be entitled to bring an action under subdivision (a)(5) of this section for breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment, after first giving the three days’ notice required by subsection (d) of this section, even though the tenant would have lost actual physical possession of the premises; accordingly, a tenant’s right to sue under this section is not invariably precluded because at the time the three days’ notice was given, the tenant was no longer in physical possession.

       <p>
        Retaliatory eviction is an affirmative defense available to tenants. A landlord’s request for eviction of a tenant under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c03s6-301" target="_blank">§§ 6-301 </a></cite>through 6-316 may be defeated by a showing that the primary motive for the eviction is retaliation against the tenant for reporting violations of housing or safety codes to authorities and seeking specific performance of repairs under this section. The tenant will carry the burden to prove the retaliatory nature of the eviction. Wright v. Brady, 126 Idaho 671, 889 P.2d 105 (Ct. App. 1995).

        The claim of a tenant to a refund of a security deposit may be subject to an offset for damages allowed to the landlord. Indeed, such a counterclaim — if it arose from the same transaction, i.e., the tenancy agreement, which forms the basis for a dispute over the security deposit — would be a compulsory one which could not be raised in a separate, independent action.

        District court erred by reinstating tenants’ third-party complaint against landlord, ruling that it was a counterclaim, because tenants failed to provide three-day notice, which was required regardless of the form in which the claim was brought.

      § 6-321. Security deposits.
     </h3>
     <p>
      Amounts deposited by a tenant with a landlord for any purpose other than the payment of rent shall be deemed security deposits. Upon termination of a lease or rental agreement and surrender of the premises by the tenant all amounts held by the landlord as a security deposit shall be refunded to the tenant, except amounts necessary to cover the contingencies specified in the deposit arrangement. The landlord shall not retain any part of a security deposit to cover normal wear and tear. “Normal wear and tear” means that deterioration which occurs based upon the use for which the rental unit is intended and without negligence, carelessness, accident, or misuse or abuse of the premises or contents by the tenant or members of his household, or their invitees or guests.
     </p>
     <p>
      Refunds shall be made within twenty-one (21) days if no time is fixed by agreement, and in any event, within thirty (30) days after surrender of the premises by the tenant. Any refunds in an amount less than the full amount deposited by the tenant shall be accompanied by a signed statement itemizing the amounts lawfully retained by the landlord, the purpose for the amounts retained, and a detailed list of expenditures made from the deposit.
     </p>
     <p>
      If security deposits have been made as to a particular rental or lease property, and the property changes ownership during a tenancy, the new owner shall be liable for refund of the deposits.

        The record supported the magistrate’s conclusion that the lease was sufficiently clear and unambiguous and that the lessors were entitled to retain the $100 security deposit under a valid and enforceable forfeiture agreement.

        This section plainly requires that, in the event less than the full amount of a deposit is returned, the landlord must provide the tenant with a “signed statement” itemizing the expenditures made by the landlord and the purpose of those expenditures; the lease agreement, by itself, does not suffice. Accordingly, the magistrate erred in his conclusion that providing oral notice of a forfeiture and a signed copy of the lease constituted compliance with this section. Fleming v.

        Where plaintiffs lost suit to quiet title to land on basis of adverse possession, second action by same plaintiffs to quiet title on theory of accretion was barred by claim preclusion, since theory of accretion grew out of same operative facts as theory of adverse possession and could have been raised in first action. Aldape v. Akins, 105 Idaho 254, 668 P.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1983).

       <p>
        When partial decrees for water rights were issued in the Snake River Basin Adjudication (SRBA), it was appropriate later to quiet title to disputed water rights to a landowner in consolidated actions, because the claims of successors in interest were precluded by res judicata, as the same claims were adjudicated in the SRBA.

        This section has not prescribed any particular form of action for determining adverse claims to mining locations under the statutes of the United States and does not preclude action in nature of ejectment at law with consequent right to the jury trial in such case. Burke v. McDonald, 2 Idaho 339, 13 P. 351 (1887).

        This section does not do away with action of ejectment, or preclude person bringing such action from alleging and proving facts required therein. McMasters v. Torsen, 5 Idaho 536, 51 P. 100 (1897).

        Where suit is brought in federal court praying for cancellation of deeds to interests in mining claim, for decree determining adverse claims of defendants to such interests and establishing complainant’s title thereto, and a receiver is prayed for to take control, and an injunction restraining defendants from taking ore therefrom pending suit, the court has jurisdiction to determine entire controversy between parties respecting the mine and ore, and it is the duty of defendants to set up all defenses they may have to complainants’ claim. Hanley v. Beatty, 117 F. 59 (9th Cir. 1902).

        Action by party actually in possession of property to quiet title to the leasehold estate is suit in equity and neither party is entitled to jury as matter of right. Shields v. Johnson, 10 Idaho 476, 79 P. 391 (1904).

        One who purchased property at an execution or tax sale received legal title and could bring an action to remove a cloud on the title created by a fraudulent transfer. Therefore, the district court had the equitable power to clear tax sale purchaser’s title by setting aside the tax debtors’ deeds to the family trust, which deeds were void and unenforceable against the tax sale purchaser. Haney v. Molko, 123 Idaho 132, 844 P.2d 1382 (Ct. App. 1992). In General.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a quiet title action challenges the title of an adversary, the plaintiff necessarily asserts his own estate in bringing a quiet title action; thus, a party seeking to quiet title against another must succeed on the strength of his own title and may not rely merely upon the weakness of his adversary. Aldape v. Akins, 105 Idaho 254, 668 P.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1983).

       </p>
       <p>
        A decree in a suit to quiet title is subject to collateral attack only on grounds of lack of jurisdiction of parties or of subject-matter. Bruun v. Hanson, 103 F.2d 685 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 308 U.S. 571, 60 S. Ct. 86, 84 L. Ed. 479 (1939).

        The district court had subject matter jurisdiction over suit to quiet title and to recover possession of real property located in Idaho purchased by plaintiffs at tax sale. Gage v. Harris, 119 Idaho 451, 807 P.2d 1289 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant who was a resident of Kootenai County did not challenge the adequacy of service of process personally served in Kootenai County, the district court acquired personal jurisdiction over him in suit to quiet title and recover possession of real property located in Idaho.

        Under this section, an action to determine adverse claims to real or personal property, to quiet title thereto, is in equity and the parties are not entitled to a jury as a matter of right; it is within the discretion of the trial court as to whether it will submit any question of fact to the jury for their finding. Shields v. Johnson, 10 Idaho 476, 79 P. 391 (1904); Fairview Inv. Co. v. Lamberson, 25 Idaho 72, 136 P. 606 (1913).

        Complaint which shows that plaintiff has an interest or right to possession of land and that defendant, without right, claims an interest or estate in said land adverse to plaintiff is sufficient without setting out what interest defendant claims. Fry v. Summers, 4 Idaho 424, 39 P. 1118 (1895).
    In action to quiet title where defendant relies upon title in himself, a cross-complaint is not necessary; where defendant seeks to enforce equitable title against plaintiff as holder of the legal title, a cross-complaint is proper. Bacon v. Rice, 14 Idaho 107, 93 P. 511 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action to quiet title, an allegation in ordinary and concise terms of the ultimate fact that plaintiff was the owner of the property was sufficient without setting out probative facts with which to thus establish that ultimate fact. Hammitt v. Virginia Mining Co., 32 Idaho 245, 181 P. 336 (1919); Ihly v. John Deere Plow Co., 35 Idaho 651, 208 P. 838 (1922).

       <p>
        A cross-complaint which described a mining claim as located on the Red Rock Lode mining claims in the Mineral Hill Mining District, Blaine County, Idaho, and recited that the claim was duly located and recorded with the County Recorder of Blaine County on Nov. 18, 1931, “reference to the records of which are hereby made for a more detailed description of said mining claim,” was not a sufficient description to give trial court jurisdiction to enter a decree quieting title to the mining claim in the cross-complaint. Norrie v. Fleming, 62 Idaho 381, 112 P.2d 482 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Complaint to quiet title which alleged in ordinary and concise language the necessary ultimate facts of ownership, possession, payment of taxes and adverse claim was sufficient to withstand a demurrer. Edgeller v. Johnston, 74 Idaho 359, 262 P.2d 1006 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a claim of title is a general claim of ownership of the property, a complaint to quiet title is sufficient if it alleges, in ordinary and concise terms, that the plaintiff is the owner of the disputed property, without setting forth the probative facts by which that ultimate fact is to be established. Aldape v. Akins, 105 Idaho 254, 668 P.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plaintiff in a quiet title action does not merely claim title by a specific theory, or assert that there is a specific defect in the adversary’s title; rather, the plaintiff claims ownership, and he claims it upon any legal theory or set of probative facts which may be employed to establish such ownership. Aldape v. Akins, 105 Idaho 254, 668 P.2d 130 (Ct. App. 1983).

        In action for adjudication of priorities in well waters tributary to lake, complaint was not demurrable because of failure to join all users of water from lake as defendants, since users not party to action were not bound by provisions of statute authorizing action and could not be injured by judgment therein, while intervening users had an ample opportunity to protect their rights as if suit had been brought under statute requiring that all water users be made parties. Owsley Canal Co. v. Henninger, 66 Idaho 485, 162 P.2d 389 (1945).

        § 6-405. Order for survey and examination.
       </h3>
       <p>
        Any person having a bona fide claim to the possession, title of, or interest in, any real property or mining claim, including any ledges thereof, which is, or which he has good reason to believe is, in the possession of another, either by surface or underground holdings or workings, and it is necessary for the ascertainment, enforcement or protection of such rights or interests, that an examination or survey of such property be had, and the person so in the possession thereof fails or refuses for three (3) days after demand on him made in writing, to permit such examination or survey to be made, the party desiring the same may apply to the court or the judge thereof, whether he have an action concerning such property pending in such court or not, for an order for such examination and survey.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such application must be made upon written petition or statement under oath, setting out a description of the property, interest of the party therein, that the premises are in the possession of a party, naming him, the reason why such survey or examination is asked, the demand made for same, and refusal thereof.
       </p>
       <p>
        The court or judge must appoint a time and place for hearing, of which notice, with a copy of the petition, must be served upon the adverse party at least three (3) days before the hearing and one (1) additional day for each twenty-five (25) miles between the place of service of notice and the hearing, and such hearing must be had and the testimony must be produced in the same manner as provided by section 8-411[, Idaho Code,] for hearings on injunctions.
       </p>
       <p>
        If upon such hearing the court or judge is satisfied that either party is entitled to any relief or order for examination or survey of any property in the possession of the other, which has, by the papers in the proceedings been put in controversy, an order must be granted for such examination, survey and other privileges as the court or judge may deem just, and the order must specify as nearly as possible what the person in whose favor such order is granted may do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thereupon, such person may have free access, with such agents and assistants as may be allowed, to all parts of such property, with right to remove any loose rock, debris or other obstacle, when the same is necessary to the making of a full inspection or survey of such property, but no such removal must be made without the consent of the adverse party or the order of the court or judge permitting the same.
       </p>
       <p>
        The court or judge may also, upon proper showing with a view of producing such evidence as may be needed to determine the rights of the parties, allow work to be done on such property, but any work so permitted must be allowed only after the same is particularly defined, and must not be allowed in such manner as to interfere with the workings of the adverse party, and then only when the court is satisfied the adverse party is acting in bad faith and is infringing or attempting so to do, upon the rights of the party asking to do such work, and when there is no other reasonable or convenient mode for the production of the evidence necessary to settle the rights of the parties.

        Wrongdoer, with knowledge of his wrongdoing and of the rights of the true owner, has no claim to permanent improvements placed upon the property unlawfully in his possession. Therefore, a district court erred when it ordered the payment of restitution to the losing party in a quiet title action after there was a finding of fraud on his part because this undermined a determination of good faith.

      Such complaint must set forth the grounds on which the owner seeks relief, stating as accurately as practicable the value of the real estate, exclusive of the improvements thereon made by the claimant or his grantors, and the value of such improvements. The issues joined thereon must be tried by the court, and the value of the real estate and of such improvements must be separately ascertained on the trial.

      When several cotenants hold and are in possession of real property as parceners, joint tenants or tenants in common, in which one (1) or more of them have an estate of inheritance, or for life or lives, or for years, an action may be brought by one (1) or more of such persons for a partition thereof, according to the respective rights of the persons interested therein, and for a sale of such property, or a part thereof, if it appears that a partition cannot be made without great prejudice to the owners.

        The statutory language of this section clearly vests the district court with equitable powers to apportion the proceeds of the sale of jointly held property after the sale: thus, any argument that the court lost jurisdiction when the property was sold was without merit.

        In dispute between cellular phone company and landowners, district court erred when it determined that partition was the sole remedy. The district court failed to balance the equities to determine if rescission was the appropriate remedy. Brewer v. Wash. RSA No. 8, L.P., 145 Idaho 735, 184 P.3d 860 (2008). Valid Partition.
       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s partitioning of real property, which belonged to tenants in common, in kind, rather than by sale, was not clearly erroneous, because the court’s partitioning of the property into unequal shares was supported by substantial and competent evidence showing the unequal contributions to the property which were made by the cotenants.

        Chapter 7 trustee was not permitted to partition co-owned property under this section, because a partition of the property, acreage that partially abutted the Snake River and only accessible from the river, was not practicable — the value of the ownership interests of all undivided interest holders being based on access to the river and the concomitant right to travel on the river free of the permitting restrictions otherwise applicable.

       </h3>
       <p>
        When it appears that partition cannot be made equal between the parties, according to their respective rights, without prejudice to the rights and interests of some of them, and a partition be ordered, the court may adjudge compensation to be made by one party to another on account of the inequality; but such compensation shall not be required to be made to others by owners unknown, nor by an infant, unless it appears that such infant has personal property sufficient for that purpose, and that his interest will be promoted thereby. And in all cases the court has power to make compensatory adjustment between the respective parties according to the ordinary principles of equity.

        A mortgage given by a guardian to secure payment by his ward of compensation awarded on account of inequality in the partition of property set off to said ward was void and the decree authorizing its execution may be collaterally attacked in an action to foreclose such mortgage.

        The filing of decree before expiration of time given defendants in partition suit as to which parcel of land they would elect to take was error, in the absence of a waiver of the time limit by defendants, even though there was no evidence that defendants were entitled to an election.

Such action shall be brought by the prosecuting attorney of the proper county, when the office or franchise relates to a county, precinct or city, and when such office or franchise relates to the state, by the attorney general; and it shall be the duty of the proper officer, upon proper showing, to bring such action whenever he has reason to believe that any such office or franchise has been usurped, intruded into, held or exercised without authority of law. Any person rightfully entitled to an office or franchise may bring an action in his own name against the person who has usurped, intruded into, or who holds or exercises the same.

        It was reversible error not to admit in evidence ballots, ballot boxes, ballot box keys and election returns offered in evidence by appellant where there was nothing to indicate such evidence was not substantially in the same condition as at the time of the election, such evidence having been rejected by the court on the ground that it was not admissible in a quo warranto proceeding to try title to an office, only being admissible in an election contest.

        Proceeding in quo warranto is not a civil action but a quasi criminal proceeding; therefore, there can be no intervention in such proceeding. People v. Green, 1 Idaho 235 (1869).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action of quo warranto to try title to an office is an action at law, and territorial statute authorizing such action to be determined at chambers without intervention of jury was in violation of the federal constitution. People ex rel. Gorman v. Havird, 2 Idaho 531, 25 P. 294 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        One remedy for reaching the ineligibility of person to hold office is by information in nature of quo warranto; the other is by a contest under express provisions of the statute. Toncray v. Budge, 14 Idaho 621, 95 P. 26 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of quo warranto was a common-law remedy and is now a statutory remedy in this state, being covered by and included in this section and the following sections; district courts of this state have original jurisdiction in proceedings by information in the nature of quo warranto, and the jurisdiction to be exercised falls within the category of cases both at law and in equity. Toncray v. Budge, 14 Idaho 621, 95 P. 26 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Remedy herein provided for an information in the nature of quo warranto is for protection of the public in its governmental and sovereign capacity, and for benefit of the community or state at large rather than for gratification, satisfaction, or protection of any particular individual, except it be one who is himself entitled to office. Toncray v. Budge, 14 Idaho 621, 95 P. 26 (1908).
       </p>

        Statutory proceedings for removal from office are in the nature of quo warranto and quasi criminal. State v. Gooding, 22 Idaho 128, 124 P. 791 (1912).

        This is not quo warranto proceeding at common law; it is usually called proceeding in nature of quo warranto notwithstanding abolition of such proceedings by territorial legislature. People ex rel. Brown v. Burnham, 35 Idaho 522, 207 P. 589 (1922).

        The election contest statute requires an action thereunder to be commenced within twenty days after the votes are canvassed whereas the usurpation of office statute does not have this limitation of time for the commencement of the action.

        It is contrary to the spirit and purpose of the ancient writ of quo warranto, and its modern form of information in the nature of quo warranto, to allow action to be prosecuted promiscuously by any and every elector. Action must be prosecuted in the name of the people of the state against the usurper or intruder and must be brought by or on relation of the district attorney of the proper county or of the attorney-general, except in the single instance where person claims himself to be originally entitled to office, when he may prosecute the action in his own name. Toncray v. Budge, 14 Idaho 621, 95 P. 26 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        If action in nature of quo warranto is not prosecuted by or on relation of the attorney-general or the proper county attorney, it is necessary for plaintiff to show some good cause why the same is not so prosecuted and to obtain permission and consent of court to act as relator himself and prosecute the action. Toncray v. Budge, 14 Idaho 621, 95 P. 26 (1908).

        Where a village located in one county passed an ordinance annexing territory in another county, the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the land sought to be annexed was located, who filed an action for a declaratory judgment to determine validity of ordinance was entitled to maintain same as a quo warranto proceeding, though quo warranto was not the exclusive remedy for testing validity of annexation.

      <li id="t06c06s6-610ol11">
       For purposes of this section, a “law enforcement officer” shall be defined as any court personnel, sheriff, constable, peace officer, state police officer, correctional, probation or parole official, prosecuting attorney, city attorney, attorney general, or their employees or agents, or any other person charged with the duty of enforcement of the criminal, traffic or penal laws of this state or any other law enforcement personnel or peace officer as defined in chapter 51, title 19, Idaho Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c06s6-610ol12">
       Before any civil action may be filed against any law enforcement officer or service of civil process on any law enforcement officer, when such action arises out of, or in the course of the performance of his duty, or in any action upon the bond of any such law enforcement officer, the proposed plaintiff or petitioner, as a condition precedent thereto, shall prepare and file with, and at the time of filing the complaint or petition in any such action, a written undertaking with at least two (2) sufficient sureties in an amount to be fixed by the court. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure diligent prosecution of a civil action brought against a law enforcement officer, and in the event judgment is entered against the plaintiff or petitioner, for the payment to the defendant or respondent of all costs and expenses that may be awarded against the plaintiff or petitioner, including an award of reasonable attorney’s fees as determined by the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c06s6-610ol13">
       In any such civil action the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of costs as otherwise provided by law. The official bond of any law enforcement officer under this section shall be liable for any such costs.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c06s6-610ol14">
       At any time during the course of a civil action against a law enforcement officer, the defendant or respondent may except to either the plaintiff’s or petitioner’s failure to file a bond or to the sufficiency of the sureties or to the amount of the bond.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c06s6-610ol15">
       When the defendant or respondent excepts to the plaintiff’s or petitioner’s failure to post a bond under this section, the judge shall dismiss the case.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c06s6-610ol16">
       When the defendant or respondent excepts to the sufficiency of the sureties[,] the sureties must be justified by the plaintiff or petitioner. Upon failure to justify the judge must dismiss the case.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c06s6-610ol17">
       When the amount of the bond is excepted to, a hearing may be held upon notice to the plaintiff or petitioner by the defendant or respondent of not less than two (2) nor more than ten (10) working days after the date the exception is filed, before the judge of the court in which the action is brought. If it appears that the bond is insufficient in amount, the judge shall order a new bond sufficient in amount to be filed within five (5) days of the date such order is received by the plaintiff or petitioner. If no such bond is filed as required by the order of the court, the judge shall dismiss the action.

        Assuming, but not deciding, that the act authorized the commissioner to procure public liability insurance, in the absence of any language expressing a waiver of immunity, the procuring of such insurance would not be sufficient to authorize an action against the state for the negligence of a police officer. Pigg v. Brockman, 79 Idaho 233, 314 P.2d 609 (1957), rev’d on other grounds, 85 Idaho 492, 381 P.2d 286 (1963).

       <p>
        The requirement of this section that plaintiff file an undertaking for costs is not jurisdictional and while the undertaking may be weighed by the defendant the statute is mandatory, so that where it is not complied with, the district court must dismiss the action when appropriate objection is timely urged by the defendant officer. Pigg v. Brockman, 79 Idaho 233, 314 P.2d 609 (1957), rev’d on other grounds, 85 Idaho 492, 381 P.2d 286 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        In view of the mandatory nature of the act directing public liability insurance on state vehicles, the issue of want of undertaking for costs was properly raised by a motion to strike rather than by demurrer for want of capacity to sue. Pigg v. Brockman, 79 Idaho 233, 314 P.2d 609 (1957), rev’d on other grounds, 85 Idaho 492, 381 P.2d 286 (1963).
    Defense of lack of bond as required by this section was waived when not asserted in responsive pleading. Garren v. Butigan, 95 Idaho 355, 509 P.2d 340 (1973).

       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff did not file a bond under this section, but argued that defendants were estopped from raising the issue. The argument lacked merit because defendants raised the issue as an affirmative defense and filed motions to dismiss within the proper deadlines. Pauls v. Green, 816 F. Supp. 2d 961 (D. Idaho 2011).

        The public object sought to be accomplished by this section is within the police power of the state and the limitation upon the rights of plaintiffs having causes of action against police officers is reasonable, that of securing an undertaking for costs; the act has a direct tendency to accomplish the legislative purpose and is not unconstitutional upon any ground urged.

        The requirement of this section that a prospective plaintiff in a suit against a law enforcement officer file an undertaking for costs is not jurisdictional and may be waived by the defendant; however, it is mandatory, and where it is not complied with, the district court must dismiss the action when the appropriate objection is timely urged by the defendant.

     <p>
      In any action for damages for the publication of a libel, in a newspaper, or of a slander or libel by radio or television broadcast, plaintiff shall recover no more than actual damages unless a correction be demanded and be not published or broadcast, as hereinafter provided. Plaintiff shall serve upon the publisher, at the place of publication or broadcaster at the place of broadcast, a written notice specifying the statements and the manner in which said statements are claimed to be slanderous or libelous and demanding that the same be corrected. Said notice and demand must be served within 20 days after knowledge of the publication or broadcast of the statement claimed to be slanderous or libelous. If a correction be demanded within said period and be not published or broadcast in substantially as conspicuous a manner in said newspaper or on said radio or television broadcasting station as were the statements claimed to be slanderous or libelous, in a regular issue thereof published or broadcast within three (3) weeks after such service, plaintiff, if he proves such notice, demand and failure to correct, and if his cause of action be maintained, may recover general, actual and exemplary damages; provided that no exemplary damages may be recovered unless the plaintiff shall prove that defendant made the publication or broadcast with actual malice, and actual malice shall not be inferred or presumed from the publication or broadcast. A correction published or broadcast in substantially as conspicuous a manner in said newspaper or on said broadcasting station as the statements claimed in the complaint to be defamatory, prior to receipt of a demand therefor, shall be of the same force and effect as though such correction has been published or broadcast within three (3) weeks after a demand therefor.

      Contributory negligence or comparative responsibility shall not bar recovery in an action by any person or his legal representative to recover damages for negligence, gross negligence or comparative responsibility resulting in death or in injury to person or property, if such negligence or comparative responsibility was not as great as the negligence, gross negligence or comparative responsibility of the person against whom recovery is sought, but any damages allowed shall be diminished in the proportion to the amount of negligence or comparative responsibility attributable to the person recovering.

        Assumption of risk shall no longer be available as an absolute bar to recovery in any action; issues should be discussed in terms of contributory negligence, not assumption of risk, and applied accordingly under comparative negligence laws. The one exception involves a situation where a plaintiff, either in writing or orally, expressly assumes the risk involved. Salinas v. Vierstra, 107 Idaho 984, 695 P.2d 369 (1985).

        Harrison
        , which was decided in January of 1989. Phillips v. United States, 801 F. Supp. 337 (D. Idaho 1992), aff’d, 15 F.3d 1088 (9th Cir. 1994).

        Although an easement owner was not required to maintain and repair easement for benefit of servient landowner, the easement owner would be held to the general standard to use ordinary care in the management of easement property; only upon a finding that the easement owner had breached its duty would a determination be made as to the effect of the servient landowner’s contributory negligence.

        Although the court must compare the quantum of negligence of the “person seeking to recover” with that of the defendant, tort and agency law may require that the court charge an individual with the negligence of another, even though that individual has played no active role in bringing about the harm.

       <p>
        Where court is apportioning negligence under comparative negligence provisions of this section, it may include parties to the transaction which resulted in the injury whether or not they are parties to the lawsuit and this is true even though<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c08s6-802" target="_blank">§ 6-802 </a></cite>uses the term “party”; although the statute requires that parties be included in the special verdict, it does not state that only parties shall be included. Pocatello Indus. Park Co. v. Steel W., Inc., 101 Idaho 783, 621 P.2d 399 (1980).

        “Individual” Rule.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Idaho has adopted the “Wisconsin” or “individual” rule, whereby the plaintiff’s negligence is compared to the negligence of each individual defendant so that a plaintiff cannot recover from a defendant found to be as negligent or less negligent than himself, rather than adopting the “unit” rule whereby plaintiff can recover from any negligent defendant, so long as plaintiff’s negligence is less than the combined negligence of all defendants; accordingly, in action for damages caused by automobile collision with cow where plaintiff was 25 percent negligent, defendant cow owner was 10 percent negligent and defendant stockmen’s association was 65 percent negligent, plaintiff could not recover damages from cow owner. Odenwalt v. Zaring, 102 Idaho 1, 624 P.2d 383 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature, when it enacted comparative negligence legislation, adopted the “individual” rule which requires that, when comparing percentages of negligence, the negligence of the plaintiff must be compared against each individual defendant in determining whether the plaintiff may recover; a plaintiff must prove that a defendant’s negligence was greater than that of the plaintiff before a judgment can be rendered against that defendant. Ross v. Coleman Co., 114 Idaho 817, 761 P.2d 1169 (1988).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the “individual rule” adopted by the Idaho legislature when it enacted comparative negligence, the negligence of the plaintiff must be compared against each individual defendant in determining whether the plaintiff may recover; in this case, the jury found that plaintiff was not negligent, but that there was negligence on the part of each of the four named defendants which was a proximate cause of any damages suffered by plaintiff; therefore, even if an unnamed party who allegedly removed the lighted barricade from the site of the excavation had been included on the verdict form, all of the named defendants would have been liable to plaintiff/motorcyclist for his injuries. Beitzel v. City of Coeur d’Alene, 121 Idaho 709, 827 P.2d 1160 (1992). In General.
       </p>
       <p>
        The questions posed under the provisions of this statute narrow and focus the factual determination by requiring a finding as to the quantum of the respective negligence of the plaintiff and defendant. Ryals v. Broadbent Dev. Co., 98 Idaho 392, 565 P.2d 982 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no language in this section requiring the abrogation of the common law remedy of equitable indemnity. Chenery v. Agri-Lines Corp., 115 Idaho 281, 766 P.2d 751 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a legislative mandate that comparative negligence shall apply in all negligence actions. Harrison v. Taylor, 115 Idaho 588, 768 P.2d 1321 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the legislature has generally espoused the comparative negligence approach for negligence actions, because it is not precluded from limiting or rejecting the application of that approach in actions arising out of particular circumstances, its enactment of a statutory bar to an action by an intoxicated person against the provider of alcohol was within its constitutional powers. Coghlan v. Beta Theta Pi Fraternity, 133 Idaho 388, 987 P.2d 300 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        As reckless conduct is recognized as a degree of negligence, this section allows reckless conduct by the defendant to be compared with the negligent conduct of the plaintiff. Accordingly, as reckless conduct is within the definition of willful and wanton conduct, willful and wanton conduct may be compared with ordinary negligence. Noel v. City of Rigby, — Idaho —, 462 P.3d 103 (2020).

        Joint and Several Liability.
       </h5>
       <p>
        The express language of portions of the comparative negligence act makes clear that the legislature intended to retain the general common law rule of joint and several liability. Tucker v. Union Oil Co., 100 Idaho 590, 603 P.2d 156 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The contention that a negligent tort-feasor’s liability is to be limited solely to his proportionate fault would undermine the fundamental rationale of the joint and several liability doctrine. Tucker v. Union Oil Co., 100 Idaho 590, 603 P.2d 156 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Underlying the rejection of limiting damages to proportionate fault is the retention of the concept that each tortfeasor whose negligence is a proximate cause of an indivisible injury should remain individually liable for all compensable damages attributable to that injury. Tucker v. Union Oil Co., 100 Idaho 590, 603 P.2d 156 (1979).

        In plaintiff’s action for recovery of damages for injuries sustained in fall, where plaintiff submitted a proposed jury instruction which was based on this section, plaintiff could not argue on appeal, from verdict denying any recovery, that this section was unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection of the law.

        Though it is not reversible error for the court to inform the jury of the effect of apportioning 50% or more of the negligence to the plaintiff, the trial courts should be given discretion not to so inform the jury in those cases where the issues are so complex or the legal issues so uncertain that such instructions would confuse or mislead the jury.

        The obviousness, or an invitee’s knowledge, of a dangerous activity or condition does not excuse the land possessor’s duty of care toward the invitee although such knowledge or the obviousness of the danger may be considered in evaluating the sufficiency of protective measures undertaken by the possessor and may be considered in evaluating a defense of contributory negligence, which may limit the land possessor’s liability. If this defense is raised, the invitee’s negligence in encountering the danger should be compared to the land possessor’s negligence in failing to protect the invitee against it. Keller v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 105 Idaho 649, 671 P.2d 1112 (Ct. App. 1983), rev’d on other grounds, 107 Idaho 593, 691 P.2d 1208 (1984).

       </p>
       <p>
        In an action for personal injuries, a plaintiff cannot recover when it is proven by the evidence that his negligence was a proximate cause of his injury, and that his negligence was equal to or greater than the negligence of the defendant notwithstanding that the evidence may also show negligence on the part of the defendant, and since in a wrongful death action, decedent’s parents’ claim arises from the same facts, they should not be entitled to recover for losses and damages resulting from their son’s death when he equally contributed to his own death.

        Since the advent of comparative negligence, contributory negligence of the plaintiff is not grounds for granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant but requires the trier of fact to compare the contributory negligence of the plaintiff with that of the defendant.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence established that plaintiff stopped his motorcycle next to the highway surface for a period of time prior to the accident, there was no obstruction to defendant’s vision as he approached point where plaintiff was stopped, but defendant stated he did not observe plaintiff until immediately before the impact, the facts did not present the rare situation where reasonable minds could not differ on an interpretation of the facts as claimed by the respective parties, so that summary judgment was not proper under this section. Robinson v. Westover, 101 Idaho 766, 620 P.2d 1096 (1980).
    In determining whether summary judgment can be granted under this section, the issue is not just whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence but whether as a matter of law, his contributory negligence was equal to or greater than the negligence of the defendant.

        In a wrongful death action in which plaintiffs alleged that their son died as a result of the reckless and negligent conduct of defendant, who had engaged the decedent to descend into a drill shaft to make repairs to broken equipment, the trial court correctly instructed the jury that the plaintiffs could not recover damages unless the decedent could have recovered for his injuries had he survived.

       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs can recover for wrongful death only when the wrongful act would have entitled the person injured to maintain an action if death had not ensued; thus, if the decedent’s negligence was not as great as that of the defendants; then decedent’s heirs would be entitled to recover for their loss reduced by the percentage of decedent’s negligence; however, where the decedent’s negligence is equal to or greater than the defendant’s negligence, then the decedent’s heirs are barred from recovery as would be the injured party had he survived.

        Although the court must compare the quantum of negligence of the “person seeking to recover” with that of the defendant, tort and agency law may require that the court charge an individual with the negligence of another, even though that individual has played no active role in bringing about the harm.

       <p>
        The legislature, when it enacted comparative negligence legislation, adopted the “individual” rule which requires that, when comparing percentages of negligence, the negligence of the plaintiff must be compared against each individual defendant in determining whether the plaintiff may recover; a plaintiff must prove that a defendant’s negligence was greater than that of the plaintiff before a judgment can be rendered against that defendant. Ross v. Coleman Co., 114 Idaho 817, 761 P.2d 1169 (1988).

        Under the “individual rule” adopted by the Idaho legislature when it enacted comparative negligence, the negligence of the plaintiff must be compared against each individual defendant in determining whether the plaintiff may recover; in this case, the jury found that plaintiff was not negligent, but that there was negligence on the part of each of the four named defendants which was a proximate cause of any damages suffered by plaintiff; therefore, even if an unnamed party who allegedly removed the lighted barricade from the site of the excavation had been included on the verdict form, all of the named defendants would have been liable to plaintiff/motorcyclist for his injuries.

        Though it is not reversible error for the court to inform the jury of the effect of apportioning 50% or more of the negligence to the plaintiff, the trial courts should be given discretion not to so inform the jury in those cases where the issues are so complex or the legal issues so uncertain that such instructions would confuse or mislead the jury.

        This section has been interpreted to allow not only that the parties be included in the special verdict, but may also include parties to the transaction which resulted in the injury whether or not they are parties to the lawsuit; the justification for placing nonparties on a jury verdict was that true apportionment could not be achieved unless it included all tortfeasors guilty of causal negligence either causing or contributing to the occurrence in question, whether or not they were parties to the case.

        Plaintiffs can recover for wrongful death only when the wrongful act would have entitled the person injured to maintain an action if death had not ensued; thus, if the decedent’s negligence was not as great as that of the defendants, then decedent’s heirs would be entitled to recover for their loss reduced by the percentage of decedent’s negligence; however, where the decedent’s negligence is equal to or greater than the defendant’s negligence, then the decedent’s heirs are barred from recovery as would be the injured party had he survived.

    In an action for personal injuries, a plaintiff cannot recover when it is proven by the evidence that his negligence was a proximate cause of his injury, and that his negligence was equal to or greater than the negligence of the defendant notwithstanding that the evidence may also show negligence on the part of the defendant; and since in a wrongful death action, decedent’s parents’ claim arises from the same facts, they should not be entitled to recover for losses and damages resulting from their son’s death when he equally contributed to his own death.

Although the state court ordered a third person, who hired the debtor and the other person to assault the creditor, to pay the creditor $300,000, the judgments were separate obligations and a satisfaction of judgment the creditor filed after the $300,000 judgment was paid did not release the debtor from his separate obligation.

       <p>
        The legislature, when it enacted comparative negligence legislation, adopted the “individual” rule which requires that, when comparing percentages of negligence, the negligence of the plaintiff must be compared against each individual defendant in determining whether the plaintiff may recover; a plaintiff must prove that a defendant’s negligence was greater than that of the plaintiff before a judgment can be rendered against that defendant. Ross v. Coleman Co., 114 Idaho 817, 761 P.2d 1169 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the “individual rule” adopted by the Idaho legislature when it enacted comparative negligence, the negligence of the plaintiff must be compared against each individual defendant in determining whether the plaintiff may recover; in this case, the jury found that plaintiff was not negligent, but that there was negligence on the part of each of the four named defendants which was a proximate cause of any damages suffered by plaintiff; therefore, even if an unnamed party who allegedly removed the lighted barricade from the site of the excavation had been included on the verdict form, all of the named defendants would have been liable to plaintiff/motorcyclist for his injuries. Beitzel v. City of Coeur d’Alene, 121 Idaho 709, 827 P.2d 1160 (1992).

        With the limitation of joint and several liability as a result of the 1987 amendment to this section, the failure to include a nonparty tortfeasor on the verdict form will affect the outcome even in cases in which there is no negligence attributable to the plaintiff(s), except where it is undisputed that the defendant is jointly and severally liable with all nonparty tortfeasors under subsection (5).

The defendant county in Utah could only be liable for a pro rata share of the total damages awarded to the injured party, based on the reckless disregard of its employee, the sheriff. Athay v.

Although the state court ordered a third person, who hired the debtor and the other person to assault the creditor, to pay the creditor $300,000, the judgments were separate obligations and a satisfaction of judgment the creditor filed after the $300,000 judgment was paid did not release the debtor from his separate obligation.

        Trial court did not err in holding that payments for medical and funeral expenses were simply part of a store’s overall settlement with a family and, therefore, the judgment against a manufacturer in a wrongful death action resulting from the same events was not improper because of the court’s denial to the manufacturer of an offset of the amount of those payments.

      A release by the injured person of one (1) joint tortfeasor does not relieve him from liability to make contribution to another joint tortfeasor unless the release is given before the right of the other tortfeasor to secure a money judgment for contribution has accrued, and provides for a reduction, to the extent of the pro rata share of the released tortfeasor, of the injured person’s damages recoverable against all the other tortfeasors.

         In all civil actions in which there has been an award of damages as herein defined, the trial judge may, in his discretion, and after considering all of the evidence, alter such portion of the award representing damages if the amount awarded; (a) is unsupported or unjustified by the clear weight of the evidence; or (b) is so unreasonably disproportionate to the loss or damage suffered or to be suffered as to be unconscionable or so as to shock the conscience of the court; or (c) is the product of a legal error or mistake during the presentation of the evidence or submission of the case to the trier of fact; or (d) is demonstrated to be more likely than not the product of passion or prejudice on the part of the trier of fact.

In the event that the court shall enter any such order, it shall make detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law explaining the reason for its action, the amount of any increase or reduction, and the basis therefore.

       <p>
        Motion for a new trial or additur by high school girl who had consensual affair with her coach/teacher was properly denied. Because a reasonable jury could have concluded that plaintiffs failed to prove their damages, the jury did not err by failing to award monetary compensation after it found the school district liable for negligent supervision and a proximate cause of the damages, especially since the student offered no evidence of her past medical, counseling, or therapy costs, or of economic loss.

        The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants’ motion for a new trial or remittitur, because it weighed the evidence and found the jury’s non-economic damages award was not unconscionable and that a retrial would not produce a different result.

        There is no basis to infer that the Idaho Tort Claims Act applies to the National Guard while engaged in disaster relief activities.

        Because city’s suit against other city, with which it had a contract to have its wastewater treated, was based on other city’s breach of a contractual obligation, rather than negligent or wrongful conduct, the Idaho Tort Claims Act was inapplicable and did not bar city’s cause of action for breach of contract or render other city immune.

        Section 1 of S.L. 1976, ch. 309 read: “The legislature of the state of Idaho hereby finds and declares that exposure of public employees to claims and civil lawsuits for acts or omissions within the course or scope of their employment has a chilling effect upon the performance of their employment duties and is an obstacle to the discharge of public business. It is the declared intention of the state of Idaho to relieve public employees from all necessary legal fees and expenses and judgments arising from such claims and civil lawsuits unless the act or omission complained of includes malice or criminal intent. The legislature further declares that the expenditure of public moneys to this end is for a public purpose.”
    Section 1 of S.L. 1986, ch. 214 read: “The legislature of the state of Idaho declares that it was the intention of the legislature in the original enactment of the Idaho tort claims act to include within the definition of ‘political subdivision’ agencies and entities, including hospitals and attached nursing homes, whether or not separately incorporated, established by counties and cities to provide for the public health of its citizens. The employees of such facilities, including elected or appointed board members, are entitled to the same protection and subject to the same standards as other employees of governmental entities. The expenditure of public moneys to this end is for a public purpose.”

        The primary function of notice under the Tort Claims Act is to put the governmental entity on notice that a claim against it is being prosecuted, and notice serving that function would not be insufficient unless the governmental entity was misled to its injury. Huff v. Uhl, 103 Idaho 274, 647 P.2d 730 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where written estimate given irrigation district by plaintiff did not contain a statement of demand, but the district was clearly apprised of the fact that a claim was being prosecuted against it and of the amount thereof, as confirmed by the activities of both district employee and district’s insurance carrier subsequent to plaintiff’s delivery of notice, and where there was no evidence that district was misled to its injury by any deficiency in notice, notice of claim was sufficient under the Tort Claims Act. Huff v. Uhl, 103 Idaho 274, 647 P.2d 730 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        A letter from the insurance company representing wrongful death defendants to the city, notifying the city of the claim against the defendants and stating that the city appeared to be responsible, did not constitute notice of a claim by the plaintiffs against the city. Stevens v. Fleming, 116 Idaho 523, 777 P.2d 1196 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term “claim,” as used in the Idaho Tort Claims Act, describes claims for damages arising from tortious conduct; therefore, plaintiff’s claim for the return of property erroneously or illegally seized for the payment of taxes does not appear to fit the definition of a claim for tort damages and is not barred by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c09s6-904A" target="_blank">§ 6-904A</a></cite>. Greenwade v. Idaho State Tax Comm’n, 119 Idaho 501, 808 P.2d 420 (Ct. App. 1991).
    Where the plaintiff alleged that she had a right to recover damages against the state transportation department because it had “negligently or intentionally secreted, destroyed, lost or mislaid” evidence, her claim for spoliation was a “claim,” as defined by the tort claim statute, and her failure to file a notice of tort claim properly resulted in dismissal of her claim.

        When plaintiffs’ school age son was injured after another student pushed him and hit him on the head, the Idaho Tort Claims Act applied to plaintiffs’ claims against the school district because it was a governmental entity under this section. The evidence did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the conduct of any school employee was reckless, willful, and wanton, because there was no evidence that the student who hit plaintiffs’ son had ever harmed another student.

        There was no doubt that the defendant teacher, accused of lewd and lascivious acts with his minor students, acted with criminal intent where he admitted to performing the lewd and lascivious acts, he specifically named each of the minor plaintiffs as the objects of his actions, he expressly stated that he acted intentionally, and he pled guilty to related criminal charges of lewd and lascivious conduct. Therefore, the school district was absolved from indemnifying the defendant as a matter of law. Doe v. Durtschi, 110 Idaho 466, 716 P.2d 1238 (1986). Dismissal.

        A Utah sheriff, pursuing an automobile into Idaho with the reasonable belief that the driver had committed a felony in Utah, does not become an employee of the state of Idaho, nor of one of its counties, by the mere fact that law enforcement officers from Idaho joined in the pursuit within the state. Because of the vicarious liability that a governmental entity can have for the acts of its employees, a person cannot become the employee of a governmental entity without its agreement. Athay v.

        The Idaho Tort Claims Act is structured in three tiers: The general rule is that governmental entities are liable for damages arising out of their own negligent or otherwise wrongful acts and for those of their employees who were acting within the course and scope of their employment. Section 6-904 then sets out certain exceptions to liability, including an exception for acts such as battery and false imprisonment commonly known as intentional torts. The third tier is also established by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c09s6-904" target="_blank">§ 6-904</a></cite>. It states that the exceptions to liability do not apply if the acts were committed with malice or criminal intent. Grant v. City of Twin Falls, 120 Idaho 69, 813 P.2d 880 (1991).

        Where automobile driver’s amended complaint alleged that arresting municipal police officers acted with malice, as a matter of law, the driver could not recover from the city, as this section specifically exempts governmental entities from liability where the employees act with malice. Sprague v. City of Burley, 109 Idaho 656, 710 P.2d 566 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in refusing to dismiss plaintiff’s tort claims against a police officer where plaintiff failed to satisfy the burden, under subsection (e), of showing that the officer, who was acting during the course and scope of employment when ordering an involuntary catheterization after plaintiff was arrested for DUI, acted maliciously or with criminal intent. Miller v. Idaho State Patrol, 150 Idaho 856, 252 P.3d 1274 (2011).
    Where, in an action against governmental entities for violation of the plaintiff’s civil rights stemming from his arrest, incarceration, and physical treatment in the county jail, the amended complaint alleged that the officers acted with malice, the plaintiff could not recover from the city, the county, or the state as a matter of law because the Tort Claims Act exempts entities from liability where the employees act with malice.

        Motion for Summary Judgment of Dismissal.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In considering a motion for summary judgment requesting dismissal of a complaint against a governmental entity and its employees under the Idaho Tort Claims Act, the trial court must answer whether tort recovery is allowed under the laws of Idaho; and, if so, whether an exception to liability found in the tort claims act shields the alleged misconduct from liability; and, if no exception applies, whether the merits of the claim as presented for consideration on the motion for summary judgment entitle the moving party to dismissal.

        Plaintiffs cited no cases from Idaho or any other jurisdiction recognizing the tort of negligent investigation of a crime. Therefore, the summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs’ claims of negligent investigation and negligent training of fish and game officers was proper. Wimer v. State, 122 Idaho 923, 841 P.2d 453 (Ct.

        Where there was no evidence to indicate that state employees intentionally and knowingly did or failed to do any act which created an unreasonable risk of harm to victim, as neither juvenile’s antecedent behavior nor present comportment presaged the vicious exploits he committed such that a reasonable person could foresee the need to restrain him from society, the department of health and welfare’s conduct in supervising the juvenile did not rise to the level of creating an unreasonable risk of harm to the public and, therefore, was not reckless, willful, and wanton.

       <p>
        Regardless of plaintiff’s contention that defendants were sued as individuals, where complaint was brought against defendants for actions performed by them in their capacity as members of the tax commission, the defendants were sued as state employees for acts or omissions committed within the course and scope of their employment, and pursuant to this section the state had an affirmative duty to furnish legal counsel for the defendants.

        The applicability of the Tort Claims Act turns on whether an alleged governmental employee committed a tortious act within the course and scope of his or her employment and whether that employee so acted without malice or criminal intent. Madsen v. Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 114 Idaho 624, 759 P.2d 915 (Ct. App. 1988).
    The discretionary function exemption to liability under the Idaho Tort Claimant Act applies only to government decisions entailing planning or policy formation and does not include functions which involve any element of choice, judgment, or ability to make responsible decisions; otherwise every function would fall within the exception. Czaplicki v. Gooding Joint Sch. Dist. No. 231, 116 Idaho 326, 775 P.2d 640 (1989).

        In considering a motion for summary judgment requesting dismissal of a complaint against a governmental entity and its employees under the Idaho Tort Claims Act, the trial court has three questions to answer: 1. Is recovery sought on the basis of an alleged tort that exists under the laws of Idaho? 2. If so, as a matter of law, does an exception to liability found in the Tort Claims Act shield the alleged misconduct from liability? 3. If no exception applies, do the merits of the claim as presented for consideration on the motion for summary judgment entitle the moving party to dismissal? Olguin v.

Therefore, as to the walkways at a highway rest area which the district court found were covered by engineering standards, the state was not provided immunity under subdivision 1 of this section, and the district court was required upon remand to perform the analysis required under subdivision 8 (now subdivision 7) of this section.

        In action brought against state by driver injured in accident on narrow bridge, the admission of evidence of design standards adopted after construction of such bridge, and the giving of an instruction indicating that immunity of a public entity may disappear if changed post-conviction conditions create a dangerous condition, were contrary to subdivision 8 (now subdivision 7) of this section and constituted reversible error. Leliefeld v. Johnson, 104 Idaho 357, 659 P.2d 111 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision 1 of this section did not immunize the state from liability for failing to place warning signs on a narrow bridge on which accident occurred. Leliefeld v. Johnson, 104 Idaho 357, 659 P.2d 111 (1983).
       </p>

        The state is not immunized from liability when, with respect to a public highway, the state maintains a known dangerous condition on the highway and fails to properly warn motorists of such a condition. Leliefeld v. Johnson, 104 Idaho 357, 659 P.2d 111 (1983).
    In an action against the state for wrongful death, injuries, and property damage resulting from an accident on a temporary construction detour, the trial court did not err in concluding that the plan or design of the detour was in substantial conformance with engineering or design standards in effect at the time of the preparation of the plan or design, and any defect in the plan or design was not a proximate cause of the decedent’s truck turning over; therefore, the trial court did not err in granting the state’s motion for a directed verdict. Elce v. State, 110 Idaho 361, 716 P.2d 505 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action against the Idaho department of transportation brought by parents of a boy killed when hit by a truck along a highway, the department was improperly granted summary judgment and was not immune from liability with regard to the plan or design of the highway, where the questions of fact concerning the advance approval of the design of the highway and conformance to engineering standards were not addressed by the court; if the two requirements of subdivision 8 (now 7) of this section were not met, immunity from liability for the plan and design of the highway will not be available to the department. Bingham v. Idaho Dep’t of Transp., 117 Idaho 147, 786 P.2d 538 (1989) (decision prior to 1988 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court erroneously determined that it was discretionary for the transportation department to determine the speed limit and place traffic signs and other signals along a highway where a child was hit and killed by a truck; the department is not engaged in activities necessarily immune from liability when it maintains or places pedestrian and vehicle traffic signs and signals along a state highway, because such activities are not a statement of policy to be followed in the future, but the implementation of policy and regulations that have already been determined sometime in the past.

        The state department of transportation has an express statutory duty with respect to erecting and maintaining signs at its highways’ intersections; the legislature in no way qualified this duty by the condition that the sign-placing or maintenance activities occur exclusively within boundaries of the state highway system; thus, contrary to the department’s position that it was without “jurisdiction” to place and maintain signs outside of its right-of-way, the department had both the authority and an express statutory duty to do so.

        Design Immunity.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under former subdivision 8 of this section (see now subdivision 7), two elements must be satisfied before the governmental entity can avail itself of the design immunity defense: the design of plan had to be in substantial conformance with then existing engineering standards and the plan of design must also have been approved in advance of the construction. Morgan v. State, 124 Idaho 658, 862 P.2d 1080 (1993).
    The addition by the legislature of the word “or” to subsection 7 by the 1988 amendment clearly indicates that immunity is available under the provision if the governmental entity shows substantial conformance or advance approval. Therefore, under subsection 7 of this section, as amended, the city was required to establish (1) the existence of a plan or design that was (2) either prepared in substantial conformance with existing engineering or design standards or approved in advance of construction by the legislative or administrative authority. Lawton v. City of Pocatello, 126 Idaho 454, 886 P.2d 330 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In personal injury action on theory that city was negligent in its design of intersection where accident occurred and that such negligence was a cause of the accident, where after it became clear that the federal funding for implementing certain safety measures was unavailable, changes actually made to the intersection were not incorporated into a written plan but city engineer was directed to proceed with cost-effective improvements to the intersection, such directions would constitute “a plan or design for improvement to the streets,” and where there was evidence that the modifications made were in compliance with Manual on Traffic Control Devices, there was sufficient evidence to raise factual questions regarding immunity under subsection 7 of this section and to preclude a directed verdict. Lawton v. City of Pocatello, 126 Idaho 454, 886 P.2d 330 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the homeowner alleged that her home was flooded as the result of a road reconstruction project performed by the city, her claims against the city for nuisance and inverse condemnation were properly dismissed upon summary judgment; the city enjoyed plan or design immunity under subsection (7) of this section. Brown v. City of Pocatello, 148 Idaho 802, 229 P.3d 1164 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        The approval required under paragraph 7 to trigger the protection of this section’s design exception provision is more than blanket approval to proceed with a project. Rather, it plainly requires meaningful review of the actual plan or design. Further, the plan or design must be sufficiently detailed that, by using it, one could accomplish the intended construction or improvement. Grabicki ex rel. Thompson v. City of Lewiston, 154 Idaho 686, 302 P.3d 26 (2013).
       </p>

        Discretionary Acts.
       </h5>
       <p>
        In applying the discretionary function exception to governmental liability, the reviewing court looks to the nature of the conduct in order to determine whether that conduct is planning or operational. If the former is the case, the government is immune even where the planning was negligent; if the latter, immunity is contingent upon the use of due or ordinary care. Sterling v. Bloom, 111 Idaho 211, 723 P.2d 755 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The discretionary function exception provides immunity to activities which involve the establishment of plans, specifications and schedules where there is room for policy judgment and decision (generally referred to as planning activities), and activities involving the implementation of statutory or regulatory policy (generally referred to as operational activities), so long as those activities are performed with due care. Sterling v. Bloom, 111 Idaho 211, 723 P.2d 755 (1986).
    A court must look at the particular conduct alleged in order to determine whether that conduct involved the exercise of discretion. Jones v. City of St. Maries, 111 Idaho 733, 727 P.2d 1161 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the Administrative Procedure Act (see<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.67.html#t67c52s67-5201" target="_blank">§ 67-5201 </a></cite>et seq.) mandates that a state brand inspector shall not accept a fresh brand as proof of ownership absent a certificate or bill of sale covering older brands, there is no room for discretion in implementing this policy directive; accordingly, where the deputy brand board inspector testified that the brands he encountered were “fresh,” but he nevertheless did not require further proof of ownership of the cattle, the trial court erred, as a matter of law in dismissing the complaint on the basis of the “discretionary function” exemption of subdivision 1 of this section. Oppenheimer Indus., Inc. v. Johnson Cattle Co., 112 Idaho 423, 732 P.2d 661 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Discretionary or planning functions of government are exempt from liability in tort, whereas operational functions conducted without “ordinary care” give rise to no governmental immunity; decisions made under statutes and regulations which leave room for policy judgment in their execution are discretionary. Oppenheimer Indus., Inc. v. Johnson Cattle Co., 112 Idaho 423, 732 P.2d 661 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wrongful death action against a county for death of an inmate was remanded to determine whether actions by the county employees involved planning or operational decisions and whether the county was entitled to immunity under the discretionary function exception to subdivision 1 of this section. Walker v. Shoshone County, 112 Idaho 991, 739 P.2d 290 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The discretionary function exception applies to government decisions entailing planning or policy formation. In suits brought under the Tort Claims Act, the “planning/operational” test is used to demarcate decisions involving the formation of basic policy, entitled to immunity, from decisions involving the execution or implementation of that policy, not entitled to immunity. Ransom v. City of Garden City, 113 Idaho 202, 743 P.2d 70 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Determining the applicability of the discretionary function exception is a two-step process. First, one must examine the nature and quality of the challenged actions. Second, the policies underlying the discretionary function exception must be considered. Ransom v. City of Garden City, 113 Idaho 202, 743 P.2d 70 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The steps for determining the applicability of discretionary function immunity are as follows: first, the nature and quality of the challenged actions must be examined; routine, everyday matters not requiring evaluation of broad policy factors will more likely than not be “operational”, while decisions and actions which involve a consideration of the financial, political, economic and social effects of a given plan or policy will generally be “planning” and fall within the discretionary function exception; second, the policies underlying the discretionary function exception must be considered, and the policies are twofold: (1) to permit those who govern to do so without being unduly inhibited in the performance of that function by the threat of liability for tortious conduct, and (2) to limit judicial re-examination of basic policy decisions properly entrusted to other branches of government. Bingham v. Franklin County, 118 Idaho 318, 796 P.2d 527 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record did not contain a sufficient factual basis to determine whether the district’s alleged failure to maintain the escape ramps along steep grade was a discretionary function it seemed likely that the decision of whether or not to build the ramps in the first instance was probably the result of a deliberate decision bound up with the formulation of policy and therefore immune from liability; however, even though there was evidence in the record that some form of maintenance on the ramps was underway just prior to the accident, these facts, without more, were too sparse to enable court to accurately ascertain whether such maintenance, or lack thereof, was a discretionary function. Freeman v. Juker, 119 Idaho 555, 808 P.2d 1300 (1991).
    The state department of transportation’s determinations whether to place signs warning of the approaching intersection, and its determination whether to erect an enlarged stop sign at the intersection, involved the implementation of the department’s policies as set forth in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and were not “discretionary” within the meaning of subdivision 1 of this section; accordingly, the department may be held liable if plaintiff can show at trial that it failed to exercise ordinary care. Roberts v. Reed, 121 Idaho 727, 827 P.2d 1178 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a city’s decision when to commence the condemnation of property for street right-of-way was discretionary, the city was immune from tort liability for its negligent failure to acquire landowner’s property with reasonable promptness. City of Lewiston v. Lindsey, 123 Idaho 841, 853 P.2d 596 (Ct. App. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subdivision (1) of this section, in determining whether an action is discretionary or optional, the court will first look at the nature of the challenged conduct. Routine matters not requiring evaluation of broad policy factors will likely be “operational,” whereas decisions involving a consideration of the financial, political, economic, and social effects of a particular plan are likely “discretionary” and will be accorded immunity. The court will evaluate the challenged conduct in light of the dual policies served by the discretionary function exception: to permit those who govern to do so without being unduly inhibited by the threat of liability and to limit judicial second-guessing of basic policy decisions entrusted to other branches of government. Lawton v. City of Pocatello, 126 Idaho 454, 886 P.2d 330 (1994).

       <p>
        In action against city for injuries resulting from auto accident caused by city’s negligent design of intersection, decision to adopt the Traffic Operations Program to Increase Capacity and Safety (TOPICS) report was a discretionary function, as was the decision to recognize and utilize the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). These decisions, involving a consideration of broad policy factors, were clearly legislative in nature. However, the challenged conduct was the decision not to use a raised median at the site of the accident. This determination involved the routine implementation of the city’s pre-determined policies as established by the 1972 TOPICS report or the MUTCD. Since it did not involve basic policy considerations, the decision was not a discretionary function within the meaning of subdivision 1 of this section. Lawton v. City of Pocatello, 126 Idaho 454, 886 P.2d 330 (1994).

        Growers’ two claims against department of agriculture for failure to disclose shortfall of inspected bean warehouse and for negligent failure to revoke the warehouse’s license were properly rejected by the district court under the discretionary function exemption to governmental liability of subdivision 1 of this section and due to the permissive language of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.69.html#t69c02s69-227" target="_blank">§§ 69-227 </a></cite>and 69-228.

       <p>
        Whether or not a city ordinance embodies a discretionary planning decision, the city cannot avoid the tort claims act simply by enacting general disclaimers of liability. Municipalities can decide whether or not to undertake particular responsibilities; they cannot define through ordinances the legal consequences of these decisions. To hold otherwise would render the discretionary function exception meaningless. Tomich v. City of Pocatello, 127 Idaho 394, 901 P.2d 501 (1995).
    District was immune from liability based upon the discretionary function exception for any failure to implement a suicide prevention program or to train its staff in such prevention. Brooks v. Logan, 127 Idaho 484, 903 P.2d 73 (1995).

        The discretionary function exception has dual policy to permit those who govern to do so without being unduly inhibited by the threat of liability and to limit judicial second-guessing of basic policy decisions entrusted to other branches of government.

        Routine matters not requiring evaluation of broad policy factors will likely be “operational,” and not subject to immunity, whereas decisions involving a consideration of the financial, political, economic, and social effects of a particular plan are likely “discretionary” and will be accorded immunity under exception of Idaho Tort Claims Act.

        Prior to the abrogation of the sovereign immunity doctrine, generally no right of recovery against the state existed; the right to recover from the state is statutory. Leliefeld v. Johnson, 104 Idaho 357, 659 P.2d 111 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In ruling on a motion for summary judgment based upon an immunity defense under the Idaho Tort Claims Act (ITCA), a trial judge should first determine whether the plaintiffs’ allegations and supporting record generally state a cause of action for which a private person or entity would be liable for money damages under the laws of the state of Idaho; the court must then determine whether an exception to liability under the ITCA shields the alleged misconduct from liability. Czaplicki v. Gooding Joint Sch. Dist. No. 231, 116 Idaho 326, 775 P.2d 640 (1989).
    The Idaho Tort Claims Act is structured in three tiers: The general rule is that governmental entities are liable for damages arising out of their own negligent or otherwise wrongful acts and for those of their employees who were acting within the course and scope of their employment. This section then sets out certain exceptions to liability, including an exception for acts such as battery and false imprisonment commonly known as intentional torts. The third tier states that the exceptions to liability do not apply if the acts were committed with malice or criminal intent. Grant v. City of Twin Falls, 120 Idaho 69, 813 P.2d 880 (1991).

        In considering a motion for summary judgment requesting dismissal of a complaint against a governmental entity and its employees under the Idaho Tort Claims Act, the trial court must answer whether tort recovery is allowed under the laws of Idaho; and, if so, whether an exception to liability found in the tort claims act shields the alleged misconduct from liability; and, if no exception applies, whether the merits of the claim as presented for consideration on the motion for summary judgment entitle the moving party to dismissal. Harris v. State, Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 123 Idaho 295, 847 P.2d 1156 (1993).
    Summary judgment was proper where the inmate failed to raise a genuine issue as to the statutory immunity provided to the county officers and, therefore, failed to show he could have succeeded on the underlying action. Farnworth v. Ratliff, 134 Idaho 237, 999 P.2d 892 (2000).

        Summary judgment was improperly granted to school district in case involving injuries sustained by student while participating in activity run by contractor hired by district. While school was immune from damages occurring as a result of ordinary negligence in their supervision of student, this immunity did not extend to damages which may have occurred as a result of district’s negligent supervision of the contractor.

        Where there was no evidence to indicate that state employees intentionally and knowingly did or failed to do any act which created an unreasonable risk of harm to victim, as neither juvenile’s antecedent behavior nor present comportment presaged the vicious exploits he committed such that a reasonable person could foresee the need to restrain him from society, the department of health and welfare’s conduct in supervising the juvenile did not rise to the level of creating an unreasonable risk of harm to the public and, therefore, was not reckless, willful, and wanton.

       </p>
       <p>
        This section, which insulates governmental entities and employees from liability arising out of injuries “by a person under supervision, custody or care of a governmental entity,” barred the injured student’s claim against high school.

       <p>
        Where it was undisputed that the persons who injured the plaintiffs’ daughter were students under the supervision of the school district, the allegation of negligent supervision of the injured student, rather than her attackers, did not overcome the immunity afforded by this section, and plaintiff’s claim was barred.

       </p>
       <p>
        No supervisory relationship existed, pursuant to this section, between a school district and a teacher who entered into a consensual sexual relationship with an 18-year-old student so that the school district was not immune from a claim by the student of negligent supervision of the teacher, if the student could point to facts supporting such a claim. However, the school district was shielded by this section from the student’s claims against the school district of negligent supervision of the student. Hei v.

    The term “claim,” as used in the Idaho Tort Claims Act, see (§ 6-902(7)), describes claims for damages arising from tortious conduct; therefore, plaintiff’s claim for the return of property erroneously or illegally seized for the payment of taxes does not appear to fit the definition of a claim for tort damages and, thus, would not be barred by this section.

        School district could only be held liable for an injury caused by a person under its supervision if its employee acted with malice or criminal intent or if the employee’s conduct was reckless, willful, and wanton. The evidence did not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the conduct of any school employee was reckless, willful, and wanton, because there was no evidence that the student who hit plaintiffs’ son had ever harmed another student.

        Where there was no evidence to indicate that state employees intentionally and knowingly did or failed to do any act which created an unreasonable risk of harm to victim, as neither juvenile’s antecedent behavior nor present comportment presaged the vicious exploits he committed such that a reasonable person could foresee the need to restrain him from society, the department of health and welfare’s conduct in supervising the juvenile did not rise to the level of creating an unreasonable risk of harm to the public and, therefore, was not reckless, willful, and wanton.

        Although affidavits of inmates were deficient in several respects, where portions of those affidavits were based on personal knowledge and established that the inmates worked in a shop with a civilian supervisor who was a state employee, a reasonable inference could be drawn that the supervisor knew of the removal of safety guards from saws and that sufficient admissible evidence existed from which a jury could find that the state’s conduct was reckless, willful and wanton.

        Where the state had investigated an accident but had no reason to suspect it might be subject to tort claims arising from the accident, the state did not have actual notice of subsequent tort claims against it which rendered literal compliance with notice provisions unnecessary; thus, plaintiffs were required to give timely notice in order to maintain a suit on their claims. Newlan v. State, 96 Idaho 711, 535 P.2d 1348, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 993, 96 S. Ct. 419, 46 L. Ed. 2d 367 (1975).

        Claim against officers who investigated shooting by police officer was precluded by the plaintiff’s failure to file a timely notice of claim with the state of Idaho as required by this section. Hopper v. Hayes, 573 F. Supp. 1368 (D. Idaho 1983).
    Trial court did not err when it granted summary judgment to the director of the department of correction where a defamation suit was brought against him by an ex-employee who, inter alia, had not first given the necessary notice under the tort claims act.

        Business owner’s notice of tort claim to the state department of agriculture was untimely because he had knowledge of facts by October 17, 2007, that would put a reasonably prudent person on notice that a possession permit for tigers would not be granted without satisfaction of the conditions stated in the October 17, 2007, letter, including that the tigers be spayed and neutered; since he did not file the notice of tort claim until May 14, 2008, his notice was clearly not timely.

        The fact that parents, whose son died as a result of an automobile accident allegedly caused by the state’s use of inappropriate paving materials, were not aware that they had a cause of action against the state until they consulted with their lawyer did not render unnecessary their compliance with the requirement that the tort claim be filed within 120 days (now 180 days) from the date the claim arose, since the parents had knowledge of the facts on the day of the accident. Newlan v. State, 96 Idaho 711, 535 P.2d 1348, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 993, 96 S. Ct. 419, 46 L. Ed. 2d 367 (1975).

        Where plaintiffs failed to present claim against the state to secretary of state within 120 days (now 180 days) after their alleged cause of action arose, the district court properly dismissed the action under authority of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c09s6-908" target="_blank">§ 6-908</a></cite>.

       <p>
        For purposes of calculating the 120-day (now 180-day) filing limit under this section, the claim against the state in cases of continuing tort is deemed to arise when all of the acts performed pursuant to the contract have been completed, since otherwise it would be difficult for the state to determine the nature or extent of its liability or prepare a defense to any claim, and settlements would either be based on pre-completion, speculative damages or would have to await the completion of the project.

        Plaintiff’s argument that she was illiterate in the English language did not change the analysis under this section, and a letter from the insurance adjuster advising plaintiff of the necessity of filing a notice of tort claim, even if plaintiff was unable to read it, was sufficient to put plaintiff on inquiry notice as to the contents of the letter and, under a reasonableness standard, started the running of the statutory notice period.

        Statutory requirement that tort claims against the state be filed within 120 days (now 180 days) from the day the claim arose or reasonably should have been discovered, though providing for a shorter period than allowed for filing claims against private tortfeasors, does not establish a suspect classification and is not unconstitutionally discriminatory in view of state’s legitimate interest in receiving timely notice so that it may investigate the claim. Newlan v. State, 96 Idaho 711, 535 P.2d 1348, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 993, 96 S. Ct. 419, 46 L. Ed. 2d 367 (1975); Curl v. Indian Springs Natatorium, Inc., 97 Idaho 637, 550 P.2d 140 (1976).

        The 120-day (now 180-day) notice provision of this section is not itself a statute of limitation since a separate section,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c09s6-911" target="_blank">§ 6-911</a></cite>, provides for limitation of actions under the Idaho Tort Claims Act; consequently, while rules of construction governing statutes of limitations may prove instructive, they are not determinative of the construction of this section.

        In applying this section to cases of continuing torts caused by projects undertaken pursuant to a contract with the state, the date upon which the project is approved and the contract accepted by the state is the time when the “act” referred to in this section is complete and the 120 days (now 180 days) available for giving notice of a claim begins to run; accordingly, in an action to recover damages for the negligent planning, construction and design of a street reconstruction project, a notice of claim filed 105 days after the date on which construction was completed and the project approved by the state was timely.

        Even if it were assumed that potential claimant should not have reasonably discovered the basis for his claim prior to July 2006 and that the Idaho Tort Claims Act,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c09s6-901" target="_blank">§ 6-901 </a></cite>et seq., allowed for the tolling of the statute of limitations on the basis of claimant’s imprisonment and lack of access to legal materials, applying equitable tolling in this circumstance would not have rendered plaintiff’s claim timely. Although plaintiff had access to his legal documents and sufficient Idaho law to begin work on his complaint in September 2007, plaintiff did not file the requisite 180-day notice of a tort claim with the secretary of state until approximately eight months later, in May 2008.

        A complaint asserting tort claims against employees of the state department of health and welfare in their official capacities was, in essence, a suit against the state and was properly dismissed for failure to comply with the notice requirements mandated by this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c09s6-908" target="_blank">§ 6-908</a></cite>.

        The notice of claim requirement of this section serves the purposes of providing an opportunity for parties to resolve their dispute through settlement without resort to the courts, allowing authorities to conduct a timely investigation of the claimant’s cause of action to determine the extent of the state’s liability, if any, and allowing the state to prepare its defenses.

        Appellant’s filing of her grievance did not provide adequate notice of a tort claim against the state; it provided notice that she had a grievance, but did not provide notice that she intended to go a step farther by bringing a tort claim. Pounds v. Denison, 120 Idaho 425, 816 P.2d 982 (1991).
    An insurance company’s awareness of an accident or medical expenses does not relieve a claimant of the burden to file a timely notice of tort claim under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c09s6-908" target="_blank">§ 6-908 </a></cite>and this section with the appropriate governmental entity in accordance with the provisions of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c09s6-907" target="_blank">§ 6-907</a></cite>.

        Where the plaintiff alleged that she had a right to recover damages against the state transportation department because it had “negligently or intentionally secreted, destroyed, lost or mislaid” evidence, her claim for spoliation was a “claim” as defined by the tort claim statute, and her failure to file a notice of tort claim properly resulted in dismissal of her claim.

        A claimant “discovers” his claim against the governmental entity only when he becomes fully apprised of the injury or damage and of the governmental entity’s role. The question of when the claimant reasonably should have discovered the governmental entity’s role is a question of material fact which, if genuinely disputed, is inappropriate for determination on a motion for summary judgment.

        Appellant’s contention that the tort claim notices sent to two neighboring counties should have served to put the county at issue on notice that a claim against it was being prosecuted, since the attorney for Idaho county reciprocal management program (ICRMP), which was the liability insurer for all three counties involved, was agent of the county at issue was held by the supreme court to be without merit as the county at issue cannot be charged with notice of a claim against it merely because the attorney for the ICRMP became aware of claims asserted against neighboring counties.

        A county highway district is a political subdivision entitled to the notice required by this section; thus the district court was correct in granting summary judgment in favor of county highway district in tort action, where plaintiff gave no timely notice of a claim but merely notified county highway superintendent after the accident that she had not been seriously injured.

        In excluding the use of the tort claim notices as prior inconsistent statements, the trial court’s reasoning that, because the purpose of a tort claim notice is merely to give notice not to assert liability, it carries even less evidentiary weight than the pleadings of a complaint, and its conclusion that the probative value of the tort claim notices was substantially outweighed by their potential to confuse or mislead the jury, properly called for exercise of trial court’s discretion.

        In plaintiff’s suit against an independent school district for damages resulting from personal injuries suffered during school hours, plaintiff’s argument that the statutory notice of claim is not required when recovery is sought from the liability carrier of the governmental entity was without merit.

        Since an insurer’s subrogation claim is derived from and dependent upon successful prosecution of the insured’s claim, notice by a motorist’s insurance carrier of a subrogation claim was therefore necessarily also notice of the motorist’s claim upon which the subrogation request was founded.

        District court erred in dismissing negligence claim against hospital on the basis that plaintiff’s notice of claim was untimely without identifying the specific alleged wrongful act or omission on the part of the hospital. The alleged negligence or wrongful act or omission must be identified before the court can determine when the claim reasonably should have been discovered. Steele v. Kootenai Med.

        In malpractice suit, trial court properly denied patient’s motion to reconsider grant of summary judgment in favor of hospital. Newly-discovered evidence that showed hospital had received copy of patient’s letter informing the Idaho state board of medicine (ISBM) of his malpractice claim did not constitute adequate notice and would not have changed the trial court’s summary judgment ruling.

        Where the state had investigated an accident but had no reason to suspect it might be subject to tort claims arising from the accident, the state did not have sufficient notice of subsequent tort claims against it which would have rendered literal compliance with notice provisions unnecessary and, thus, plaintiffs were required to give timely notice in order to maintain suit on their claims.

    Appellant’s contention that the tort claim notices sent to two neighboring counties should have served to put the county at issue on notice that a claim against it was being prosecuted, since the attorney for Idaho county reciprocal management program (ICRMP), which was the liability insurer for all three counties involved, was agent of the county at issue was held by the supreme court to be without merit as the county at issue cannot be charged with notice of a claim against it merely because the attorney for the ICRMP became aware of claims asserted against neighboring counties.

        Bail bond company’s claim under Idaho Const., Art.

        Since the tort claims act has an express statute of limitations which begins to run commencing with the filing of the notice of claim, the notice of claim requirement is not a statute of limitations.

        Where plaintiff and state stipulated to a dismissal of an action originally filed in a federal court, the provisions of 28 U.S.C.S. § 1367(d) did not toll the statute of limitations.

        Contention that this section, when viewed in contrast to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.12.html#t12c01s12-121" target="_blank">§ 12-121</a></cite>, discriminates impermissibly against those tort plaintiffs whose claims lie against a governmental entity rather than against private parties would not be addressed by court where attorney fees in particular case could not have been awarded under either statute because of failure to show that case was defended frivolously or without foundation. Packard v. Joint Sch. Dist. No. 171, 104 Idaho 604, 661 P.2d 770 (Ct. App. 1983).

        Although the appeal was taken on dubious grounds, it did not warrant a fee award under this section. Bissett v. Unnamed Members of Political Compact, 111 Idaho 863, 727 P.2d 1291 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>

        Because there was no indication that an appeal was pursued frivolously, in bad faith, or without foundation, there was no basis for an award of fees. Jensen v. State, 139 Idaho 57, 72 P.3d 897 (2003).

        Where the owners of a cabin sued the county and a county inspector after the owners were issued a building permit from the county indicating that the county building inspector had completed a plan review check sheet, only to find out later that the cabin structure did not meet the snow load requirements, the county and the county inspector were not entitled to recover attorney fees on appeal since there was no evidence that the owners pursued the appeal in bad faith.

        Because there was no indication that the guardians were guilty of bad faith in the commencement, conduct, or maintenance of their action against the county, and indeed, prevailed twice on appeal, there was no basis for an award of attorney fees to the county.

        In corrections officers’ suit based on the disclosure of personal information, where defendants were granted summary judgment, attorney fees were denied on appeal to the officers and defendants because there was no evidence that either party commenced, conducted, maintained, or defended the action in bad faith.

        School district’s request for attorney fees was denied where it could not be said that the teacher pursued the appeal against the district in bad faith. Cordova v. Bonneville County Joint Sch. Dist. No. 93, 144 Idaho 637, 167 P.3d 774 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a personal injury action, the student’s parents were not entitled to attorney fees on appeal under this section because there was no showing that the school acted in bad faith, as much of their argument centered around its claim that Idaho law supported a different standard for recklessness than the district court applied, and its argument was not frivolous before the trial court. Hennefer v. Blaine County Sch. Dist. #61, 158 Idaho 242, 346 P.3d 259 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a property owner was entitled to costs on appeal as the prevailing party in an action against an irrigation district, it was not entitled to attorney fees, because the owner did not claim attorney fees under this section, which controls the award of attorney’s fees under the Idaho tort claims act. CNW, LLC v. New Sweden Irrigation Dist., 161 Idaho 89, 383 P.3d 1259 (2016).
    Denial of a request by a police department and police officers for an award of attorneys fees was appropriate, because the police department and the officers did not show by clear and convincing evidence that the claimants acted with bad faith on appeal. Dodge v. Bonners Ferry Police Dep’t, — Idaho —, 450 P.3d 298 (2019).

        The $100,000 recovery limitation under the Idaho Tort Claims Act was not unconstitutional on its face or as applied to recovery by parents of child killed by school bus since fair and substantial relationship existed between the limitation, upon which the school district based its insurance coverage, and the legislative objective of conserving public funds. Packard v. Joint Sch. Dist. No. 171, 104 Idaho 604, 661 P.2d 770 (Ct. App. 1983) (recovery limit now $500,000).

       <p>
        Since the legislative history of former similar statute indicated that the legislature was aware that it was establishing a classification and did so deliberately and not as a result of accident or ignorance, it was logical to infer from the legislative intent to enact the recovery limitation and the state’s purported objective to protect the public coffers, which was a reasonably conceived objective, that the recovery limitation had a rational basis and the recovery limitations of the section were not unconstitutional. Leliefeld v. Johnson, 104 Idaho 357, 659 P.2d 111 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language of the 1978 amendments to former section, which was not a response to judicial interpretation and appeared to reflect the then existing practice, seemed to clearly reveal that legislative intent at all times was simply to place a cap on the state’s liability rather than to prevent a plaintiff from demonstrating all items and amounts of damage which may have been suffered. Barringer v. State, 111 Idaho 794, 727 P.2d 1222 (1986).

       <p>
        Former similar provision did not permit a recovery of up to $300,000 to any one person where more than one person was making a claim. From the language of the statute and its legislative history, it was clear that the legislature intended to limit recovery to one person arising from personal injury or death to $100,000 unless the governmental entity had secured insurance coverage in excess of that amount. Leliefeld v. Johnson, 104 Idaho 357, 659 P.2d 111 (1983) (recovery limit now $500,000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under former similar statute there existed a valid relationship between the limitation on recoveries against the state and the avowed purpose of the statute which was to protect the public coffers. Leliefeld v. Johnson, 104 Idaho 357, 659 P.2d 111 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The recovery limitation under the Idaho Tort Claims Act may reflect two legislative purposes: (a) providing for effective risk management by public entities and their insurers, and (b) protecting the public coffers; these are legitimate, important state objectives. The first objective — risk management — does not favor any particular recovery limitation, but rather, it simply requires that recovery be restricted at some finite level so that risk exposure can be projected and informed underwriting decisions can be made; however, the second objective — conserving public funds — appears on its face to be directly related to the recovery limitation level selected since the greater the maximum allowable recovery, the greater annual expenditure must be made upon insurance premiums by the state and those political subdivisions which are not self-insured. Packard v. Joint Sch. Dist. No. 171, 104 Idaho 604, 661 P.2d 770 (Ct. App. 1983).
    The $100,000 limitation in former law for “personal injury or death of any person” referred to the person injured or killed, and not the person claiming compensation as an heir; therefore, the limit of liability of the state as a result of any wrongful death of the decedent was $100,000, and that $100,000 limitation was not increased or altered by the fact the decedent left surviving him more than one person entitled to make claim therefor. Barringer v. State, 111 Idaho 794, 727 P.2d 1222 (1986) (recovery limit now $500,000).

      § 6-1001. Hearing panel for prelitigation consideration of medical malpractice claims — Procedure.
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Idaho state board of medicine, in alleged malpractice cases involving claims for damages against physicians and surgeons practicing in the state of Idaho or against licensed acute care general hospitals operating in the state of Idaho, is directed to cooperate in providing a hearing panel in the nature of a special civil grand jury and procedure for prelitigation consideration of personal injury and wrongful death claims for damages arising out of the provision of or alleged failure to provide hospital or medical care in the state of Idaho, which proceedings shall be informal and nonbinding, but nonetheless compulsory as a condition precedent to litigation. Proceedings conducted or maintained under the authority of this act shall at all times be subject to disclosure according to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply and all such proceedings shall be expeditious and informal.

        While filing with the prelitigation screening panel pursuant to this section is a condition precedent to proceeding with district court litigation, such as filing interrogatories or setting trial dates, it is not a condition precedent to filing an action in order to toll the statute of limitations; therefore, there was no error in the district court’s decision to stay the proceedings pursuant to<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c10s6-1006" target="_blank">§ 6-1006 </a></cite>instead of dismissing where the plaintiff’s malpractice complaint was filed within the two year limitation period, but her request for a prelitigation screening panel was filed after the running of the limitation period.

     <p>
      In any case, claim or action for damages due to injury to or death of any person, brought against any physician and surgeon or other provider of health care, including, without limitation, any dentist, physicians’ assistant, nurse practitioner, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, nurse anesthetist, medical technologist, physical therapist, hospital or nursing home, or any person vicariously liable for the negligence of them or any of them, on account of the provision of or failure to provide health care or on account of any matter incidental or related thereto, such claimant or plaintiff must, as an essential part of his or her case in chief, affirmatively prove by direct expert testimony and by a preponderance of all the competent evidence, that such defendant then and there negligently failed to meet the applicable standard of health care practice of the community in which such care allegedly was or should have been provided, as such standard existed at the time and place of the alleged negligence of such physician and surgeon, hospital or other such health care provider and as such standard then and there existed with respect to the class of health care provider that such defendant then and there belonged to and in which capacity he, she or it was functioning. Such individual providers of health care shall be judged in such cases in comparison with similarly trained and qualified providers of the same class in the same community, taking into account his or her training, experience, and fields of medical specialization, if any. If there be no other like provider in the community and the standard of practice is therefore indeterminable, evidence of such standard in similar Idaho communities at said time may be considered. As used in this act, the term “community” refers to that geographical area ordinarily served by the licensed general hospital at or nearest to which such care was or allegedly should have been provided.

        Where evidence suggested strongly that plaintiff herself believed the accident was covered by this section and it was not until she was left without an expert to support her position that she developed the theory — a theory which goes against the clear and unambiguous language of the statute and a theory for which plaintiff cannot find support for in any language in the statute, its legislative history, or Idaho case law — that she now presents on appeal, the court found such appeal frivolous, unreasonable and without foundation and awarded reasonable attorney fees to the respondents.

        Even assuming that utilization of res ipsa loquitur is now precluded by the statutory language of this section which states that in a claim for damages in a medical malpractice action, the “plaintiff must, as an essential part of his or her case in chief, affirmatively prove by direct expert testimony . . .,” this section did not retroactively change the burden on plaintiffs in a malpractice action involving an unsuccessful inner ear operation since the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur would not apply to such case even under the prior case law.

        Under this section, plaintiff suing for malpractice had to affirmatively prove by direct expert testimony and by a preponderance of all the competent evidence that the defendant physician negligently failed to meet the applicable standard of health care practice of the community in which the care was provided at the time that care was given.

       <p>
        Unlike the elements of duty and breach of duty, there is no statutory requirement explicitly stating that proximate cause in medical malpractice cases must be shown by direct expert testimony; therefore, testimony admissible to show proximate cause in a medical malpractice case, like any other case, is governed by the rules of evidence regarding opinion testimony by lay witnesses and experts under Idaho Evid. R. 701 and 702. Sheridan v. Saint Luke’s Reg’l Med. Ctr., 135 Idaho 775, 25 P.3d 88 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although expert testimony is not expressly required to establish causation in medical malpractice cases, such testimony is often necessary given the nature of the cases. Expert testimony is generally required because the causative factors are not ordinarily within the knowledge or experience of laymen composing the jury. Easterling v.

        Where in opposition to defendants’ motions for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action plaintiffs submitted two affidavits of physicians, both practicing outside the state that the surgery should have been postponed and that it was a departure from optimal patient care to not postpone an elective surgery under such circumstances, neither affidavit demonstrated any knowledge of the applicable standard of care in the local community and was wholly insufficient to satisfy the burden of plaintiffs at the summary judgment juncture in a medical malpractice action.

        The admissibility of expert testimony is a matter committed to the discretion of the trial court, and the court’s ruling will not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion. The sequence of inquiry to determine if there has been an abuse of discretion is: (1) whether the court correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) whether the court acted within the outer boundaries of its discretion and consistently with the applicable legal standards; and (3) whether the court reached its decision by an exercise of reason.

        Opinions of expert witnesses are allowable when it is the community standard of care that is the focus of their testimony. The district court properly allowed two experts to testify as to what conduct they would characterize as reaching a level of negligence that they saw as reckless. This testimony was permissible because (1) the experts had acquainted themselves adequately with the community standard for health care providers, and (2) their opinions as to the level of negligence of specific actions of a health care provider were not conclusions that the average juror would be qualified to draw.

    District court did not abuse its discretion in a negligence action by refusing to admit the expert testimony of the claimants’ out-of-area doctor as to the local community standard of care in the administration of anesthesia services because: (1) the doctor’s conversation with the associate director of the Idaho state board of nursing was not sufficient to show that the doctor had acquired actual knowledge of the local standard of care; and (2) the statewide and national standards cited by the doctor had not replaced the local standard of care.

        District court erred in holding that a patient was shielded from disclosing the identity of a non-testifying medical expert (who had been consulted by a testifying expert to familiarize the testifying expert with the applicable local standard of care), because, while nothing in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c10s6-1013" target="_blank">§ 6-1013 </a></cite>or this section required the disclosure of the identity of the non-testifying expert as part of the foundation for the testifying expert’s testimony, the identity of the non-testifying expert was discoverable under Idaho Civil Rule 26. The doctor had a legitimate interest in knowing who the non-testifying expert was so that he could prepare his defense, and secreting the identity of the non-testifying expert is incompatible with Idaho’s system of justice.

        Hospital could be found vicariously liable for the negligence of an independently contracted cell saver technician under Idaho’s doctrine of apparent agency. The extension of apparent agency to medical malpractice claims is consistent with the provision for vicarious liability set forth in this section. Jones v.

    Because defendant doctor was one of only six cardiovascular surgeons in the state of Idaho and all six of these cardiovascular surgeons practiced together in Boise as a professional association, the standard of health care practice in the community ordinarily served by hospital was indeterminable and no “similar Idaho communities” existed about which plaintiff could have presented evidence of the standard of practice for a cardiovascular surgeon performing patent ductus arteriosus surgery; therefore, this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c10s6-1013" target="_blank">§ 6-1013 </a></cite>did not provide a means of establishing the applicable standard of practice in this case; in resolving whether out-of-state doctor qualified as an expert witness to testify on plaintiff’s behalf, the court turned to decisions predating the enactment of this section and<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c10s6-1013" target="_blank">§ 6-1013</a></cite>. Hoene v. Barnes, 121 Idaho 752, 828 P.2d 315 (1992). In General.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is nothing in the Idaho Medical Malpractice Act,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c10s6-1001" target="_blank">§§ 6-1001 </a></cite>to 6-1014, that suggests that the common-law causes of action that predated passage would be eliminated. There is nothing in the act itself to suggest various causes of action were being eliminated or merged into a single cause of action for malpractice. The difference between negligence and malpractice is a matter of degree. If an individual, through carelessness or disregard, commits or omits to perform a certain act or duty upon or directed towards another, he is said to be negligent. When the negligence arises out of a relationship between a layman and a professional and is directly attributable to the professional care, treatment, advice, representation, services, or conduct, negligence is transmuted into malpractice. Eldridge v. West, — Idaho —, 458 P.3d 172 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        The medical malpractice act does not categorically supplant all common-law causes of action. Instead, the analysis should be whether the cause of action alleges damages that arise out of the “account of the provision of or failure to provide health care.” If so, the plaintiff must comply with the expert testimony requirements stated in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c10s6-1013" target="_blank">§ 6-1013 </a></cite>and this section. Eldridge v. West, — Idaho —, 458 P.3d 172 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section only applies to claims that sound in negligence. The elements of a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress are significantly different from a case of ordinary negligence. For example, it requires proof that the conduct was “intentional or reckless” and “extreme and outrageous.” Eldridge v. West, — Idaho —, 458 P.3d 172 (2020).

        Instructions.

       <p>
        In a medical malpractice action, the instruction which stated that the performance of a board-certified specialist physician is to be measured against the local community standard was not erroneous. Grimes v. Green, 113 Idaho 519, 746 P.2d 978 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The combination of instructions on negligence was proper, where it sufficiently informed the jury of the legal standard contained in this section. Smallwood v. Dick, 114 Idaho 860, 761 P.2d 1212 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The given instructions in a medical malpractice action were based upon the legislative standards set forth in this section, and, accordingly, there was no error committed by the trial court in the instructions given or in refusing appellants’ requested negligence instructions. Robertson v. Richards, 115 Idaho 628, 769 P.2d 505 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the instructions did not follow the exact language of this section and erroneously defined “community” for the purpose of determining whether the physician’s disclosures were adequate did not result in prejudice to plaintiff, and although not technically correct, the instructions did not constitute reversible error. Sherwood v. Carter, 119 Idaho 246, 805 P.2d 452 (1991), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., — Idaho —, — P.3d —, 2011 Ida. LEXIS 149 (Nov. 9, 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        A former Idaho Jury Instruction 230 correctly stated the proper proximate cause instruction under the circumstances of this case; therefore, in an action for medical malpractice when there is evidence of two or more causes that contributed to the damage suffered, for only one of which the doctor is responsible, the proper proximate cause instruction should instruct the jury that any negligence of the doctor was a proximate cause of the injury if it was a substantial factor in bringing about the damage, and the supreme court specifically rejected the inclusion of an instruction under these circumstances requiring the claimant to prove that the injury would not have occurred “but for” the doctor’s negligence. Fussell v. St. Clair, 120 Idaho 591, 818 P.2d 295 (1991).
    By enacting this section, the legislature replaced the applicable standard of care then in effect with a new standard and, pursuant to this new standard, the jury instruction given by the court inaccurately stated the applicable Idaho Law by incorporating “best judgment” in the standard of care for medical malpractice. Leazer v. Kiefer, 120 Idaho 902, 821 P.2d 957 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        In malpractice action, district court properly instructed the jury regarding the standard of care in medical malpractice cases where the language of the instruction mirrored the language of this section and the portion of the instruction limiting the consideration of the standard of care in similar communities to situations in which the local standard within the community is indeterminable was correct. Morris ex rel. Morris v. Thomson, 130 Idaho 138, 937 P.2d 1212 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The wording “all competent evidence” is a legally sufficient instruction in a medical malpractice claim. Perry v. Magic Valley Reg’l Med. Ctr., 134 Idaho 46, 995 P.2d 816 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In medical malpractice action, district court did not err in refusing defendant doctor’s proferred standard of care instruction; reviewing court declined to address whether proferred instruction was erroneous, since instructions actually given by trial court adequately covered the requisite elements. Puckett v. Verska, 144 Idaho 161, 158 P.3d 937 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a medical malpractice action, the trial court did not err in declining to give plaintiffs’ proposed instruction on negligence per se because the instruction was an erroneous statement of law; the instruction that the trial court gave properly and adequately stated the statutory requirements for proving negligence. Schmechel v. Dille, 148 Idaho 176, 219 P.3d 1192 (2009).

       <p>
        Because there was no indication that expert inquired of a local doctor, and plaintiff did not state that the local standard of care was the same as the national standard, there was not sufficient foundation in expert’s affidavit to show that expert had actual knowledge of the applicable community standard. Rhodehouse v. Stutts, 125 Idaho 208, 868 P.2d 1224 (1994).

        District court abused its discretion in holding that a patient and wife did not lay an adequate foundation to admit an expert surgeon’s testimony, where the surgeon’s affidavit established that he had replaced another doctor as general surgeon at the medical facility a mere 22 months after the incident at issue, had fully reviewed the files regarding the care provided to the patient, and had familiarized himself with the applicable, community standard of care.

       <p>
        In a medical malpractice action, the argument that there is but one national standard of care for board-certified specialists and that any community standard is superfluous is not without merit, however, it flies in the face of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c10s6-1013" target="_blank">§ 6-1013 </a></cite>and has been rejected by the Idaho Supreme Court.

       </p>
       <p>
        A national standard of care is not automatically implicated simply because the federal government has created a general regulatory scheme for a given area of medicine; thus, in a medical malpractice action, the testimony of the plaintiffs’ expert witness was properly excluded, where he failed to establish that he had actual knowledge of the applicable community standard of care. McDaniel v. Inland Northwest Renal Care Group-Idaho, L.L.C., 144 Idaho 219, 159 P.3d 856 (2007).

       <p>
        The legislature intended that nationally board-certified specialists can testify regarding the standard of care against other nationally board-certified specialists practicing in the same area of medicine; the residence of a board-certified physician should not be a basis for precluding his testimony. Buck v. St. Clair, 108 Idaho 743, 702 P.2d 781 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Samples v. Hanson, — Idaho —, 384 P.3d 943 (2016).

       <p>
        An out-of-state, board-certified orthopedic surgeon’s naked assertion that because he was familiar with the national standard of care he was also familiar with what was expected of an instate board-certified orthopedic surgeon was totally insufficient to render him competent to testify concerning the applicable standard of care in a medical malpractice suit against an instate surgeon. Strode v. Lenzi, 116 Idaho 214, 775 P.2d 106 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        An expert from outside the state must demonstrate that he possesses knowledge of the local community standard. If he is board-certified in the same specialty, he must, at a minimum, inquire of a local specialist to determine whether the local community standard varies from the national standard for that board-certified specialty.

       <p>
        In a medical malpractice action against a board-certified pediatrician and a board-certified surgeon, the affidavit of a doctor who was not board-certified in either pediatrics or surgery was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact and to defeat the motion for summary judgment of the defendants where he demonstrated that he was judging the defendants in comparison with similarly trained and qualified physicians in the same community, taking into account their training, experience, and fields of medical specialization, he was a knowledgeable, competent expert witness, he actually held an opinion about the applicable standard of practice and the failure of the defendants to meet the standard, his opinion was rendered with reasonable medical certainty, and he possessed professional knowledge and expertise coupled with actual knowledge of the applicable community standard to which his expert opinion testimony was addressed.

Additionally, the hospital’s expert stated that: “many of the statements made by plaintiff’s experts regarding the local standard of care for Gentamicin use in 2000 are incorrect;” that statement alone showed that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding the standard of care for the hospital in 2000.

     <p>
      The applicable standard of practice and such a defendant’s failure to meet said standard must be established in such cases by such a plaintiff by testimony of one (1) or more knowledgeable, competent expert witnesses, and such expert testimony may only be admitted in evidence if the foundation therefor is first laid, establishing (a) that such an opinion is actually held by the expert witness, (b) that the said opinion can be testified to with reasonable medical certainty, and (c) that such expert witness possesses professional knowledge and expertise coupled with actual knowledge of the applicable said community standard to which his or her expert opinion testimony is addressed; provided, this section shall not be construed to prohibit or otherwise preclude a competent expert witness who resides elsewhere from adequately familiarizing himself with the standards and practices of (a particular) such area and thereafter giving opinion testimony in such a trial.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Extension of apparent agency to medical malpractice claims does not change the standard for establishing negligence on the part of a healthcare provider; rather, it provides an additional basis from which the hospital’s liability can arise. When a hospital is being sued in its capacity as an individual healthcare provider, the plaintiff is still required to prove that the hospital breached the applicable standard of care. Jones v. Healthsouth Treasure Valley Hosp., 147 Idaho 109, 206 P.3d 473 (2009).

       <p>
        Although expert testimony is not expressly required to establish causation in medical malpractice cases, such testimony is often necessary given the nature of the cases. Expert testimony is generally required because the causative factors are not ordinarily within the knowledge or experience of laymen composing the jury. Easterling v.

       <p>
        Section 6-1012 and this section, in establishing a standard of medical care based on the local community, do not create a classification which rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the state’s objective and, therefore, such statutes do not violate the equal protection clause of either the United States Constitution or the Idaho Constitution. LePelley v. Grefenson, 101 Idaho 422, 614 P.2d 962 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 6-1012 and this section did not retroactively establish a different burden of proof that must be met to sustain an action for medical malpractice, thereby violating Idaho Const., Art. XI, § 12, by providing: (1) that the standard of practice and the failure of the medical person to meet the standard must be established by expert testimony and (2) that the standard of care shall be that of the local community; both were the standards before the enactment of the statutes, and the legislature merely codified already existing case law.

        The admissibility of expert testimony is a matter committed to the discretion of the trial court, and the court’s ruling will not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion. The sequence of inquiry to determine if there has been an abuse of discretion is: (1) whether the court correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) whether the court acted within the outer boundaries of its discretion and consistently with the applicable legal standards; and (3) whether the court reached its decision by an exercise of reason.

He, therefore, could not qualify as an expert witness under this section. Hollingsworth v. United States, 928 F. Supp. 1023 (D. Idaho 1996). Familiarity with Local Standards.

        Where, in opposition to defendants’ motions for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action, plaintiffs submitted two affidavits of physicians, both practicing outside the state, that the surgery should have been postponed and that it was a departure from optimal patient care to not postpone an elective surgery under such circumstances, neither affidavit demonstrated any knowledge of the applicable standard of care in the local community and they were wholly insufficient to satisfy the burden of plaintiffs at the summary judgment juncture.

       <p>
        An expert from outside the state must demonstrate that he possesses knowledge of the local community standard. If he is board-certified in the same specialty, he must, at a minimum, inquire of a local specialist to determine whether the local community standard varies from the national standard for that board-certified specialty.

       </p>

        Expert’s affidavit did not present sufficient facts admissible in evidence to demonstrate affirmatively that expert was familiar with the local standard of care; because the trial court found expert’s affidavit was not admissible evidence under Idaho R.

       <p>
        It is sufficient for the out-of-state expert to gain the requisite familiarity with the standards of the community by conferring with local authorized personnel and stating that the standard did not deviate from the national standard.

       </p>
       <p>

       </p>
       <p>
        The district court properly allowed two experts to testify as to what conduct they would characterize as reaching a level of negligence that they saw as reckless. This testimony was permissible because (1) the experts had acquainted themselves adequately with the community standard for health care providers, and (2) their opinions as to the level of negligence of specific actions of a health care provider were not conclusions that the average juror would be qualified to draw.

        District court did not abuse its discretion in a negligence action by refusing to admit the expert testimony of the claimants’ out-of-area doctor as to the local community standard of care in the administration of anesthesia services because: (1) the doctor’s conversation with the associate director of the Idaho state board of nursing was not sufficient to show that the doctor had acquired actual knowledge of the local standard of care; and (2) the statewide and national standards cited by the doctor had not replaced the local standard of care.

        To be considered competent, a medical expert must show that he or she is familiar with the standard of health care practice for the relevant medical specialty, during the relevant timeframe, and in the community where the care was provided and must explain how he or she became familiar with that standard of care.

        District court abused its discretion in holding that a patient and wife did not lay an adequate foundation to admit an expert surgeon’s testimony, where the surgeon’s affidavit established that he had replaced another doctor as general surgeon at the medical facility a mere 22 months after the incident at issue, had fully reviewed the files regarding the care provided to the patient, and had familiarized himself with the applicable, community standard of care.

    District court erred in holding that a patient was shielded from disclosing the identity of a non-testifying medical expert (who had been consulted by a testifying expert to familiarize the testifying expert with the applicable local standard of care), because, while nothing in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c10s6-1012" target="_blank">§ 6-1012 </a></cite>or this section required the disclosure of the identity of the non-testifying expert as part of the foundation for the testifying expert’s testimony, the identity of the non-testifying expert was discoverable under Idaho Civil Rule 26. The doctor had a legitimate interest in knowing who the non-testifying expert was so that he could prepare his defense, and secreting the identity of the non-testifying expert is incompatible with Idaho’s system of justice.

       <p>
        Since this section requires an expert witness to possess professional knowledge and expertise coupled with actual knowledge of the applicable community standard, and because the phrase “coupled with” denotes a contemporaneous relationship, awareness of the standard must exist when the expert testimony is given; if contemporaneous awareness is not demonstrated, the expert’s testimony is subject to being excluded or stricken at trial, and such evidence is not entitled to evidentiary weight in summary judgment proceedings. Kunz v. Miciak, 118 Idaho 130, 795 P.2d 24 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because there was no indication that expert inquired of a local doctor, and plaintiff did not state that the local standard of care was the same as the national standard, there was not sufficient foundation in expert’s affidavit to show that expert had actual knowledge of the applicable community standard. Rhodehouse v. Stutts, 125 Idaho 208, 868 P.2d 1224 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires that the expert have not only “knowledge,” but also “expertise.” When the two terms are read together with their common definitions in mind, they mean that an expert must possess a combination of learning and experience.

    Because defendant doctor was one of only six cardiovascular surgeons in the state of Idaho and all six of these cardiovascular surgeons practiced together in Boise as a professional association, the standard of health care practice in the community ordinarily served by hospital was indeterminable and no “similar Idaho communities” existed about which plaintiff could have presented evidence of the standard of practice for a cardiovascular surgeon performing patent ductus arteriosus surgery; therefore,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c10s6-1012" target="_blank">§ 6-1012 </a></cite>and this section did not provide a means of establishing the applicable standard of practice in this case and, in resolving whether out-of-state doctor qualified as an expert witness to testify on plaintiff’s behalf, the court turned to decisions predating the enactment of<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c10s6-1012" target="_blank">§ 6-1012 </a></cite>and this section.

       <p>
        In a medical malpractice action the argument that there is but one national standard of care for board-certified specialists and that any community standard is superfluous is not without merit, however, it flies in the face of this section and has been rejected by the Idaho Supreme Court. Kunz v. Miciak, 118 Idaho 130, 795 P.2d 24 (Ct. App. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        A national standard of care is not automatically implicated simply because the federal government has created a general regulatory scheme for a given area of medicine; thus, in a medical malpractice action, the testimony of the plaintiffs’ expert witness was properly excluded, where he failed to establish that he had actual knowledge of the applicable community standard of care.

       <p>
        The legislature intended that nationally board-certified specialists can testify regarding the standard of care against other nationally board-certified specialists practicing in the same area of medicine; the residence of a board-certified physician should not be a basis for precluding his or her testimony. Buck v. St. Clair, 108 Idaho 743, 702 P.2d 781 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Samples v. Hanson, — Idaho —, 384 P.3d 943 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to meet the requirement of showing adequate familiarization under clause (c) of this section, a nationally board-certified specialist must demonstrate two elements: First, that he is board-certified in the same specialty as that of the defendant-physician; this demonstrates knowledge of the appropriate standard of care of board-certified physicians practicing in the specialty in question. Second, an out-of-the-area doctor must inquire of the local standard in order to insure there are no local deviations from the national standard under which the defendant-physician and witness-physician were trained. Buck v. St. Clair, 108 Idaho 743, 702 P.2d 781 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Samples v. Hanson, — Idaho —, 384 P.3d 943 (2016).
    An out-of-state, board-certified orthopedic surgeon’s naked assertion, that because he was familiar with the national standard of care he was also familiar with what was expected of an instate board-certified orthopedic surgeon, was totally insufficient to render him competent to testify concerning the applicable standard of care in a medical malpractice suit against an instate surgeon.

        In a medical malpractice action against a board-certified pediatrician and a board-certified surgeon, the affidavit of a doctor who was not board-certified in either pediatrics or surgery was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact and to defeat the motion for summary judgment of the defendants where he demonstrated that he was judging the defendants in comparison with similarly trained and qualified physicians in the same community, taking into account their training, experience, and fields of medical specialization, he was a knowledgeable, competent expert witness, he actually held an opinion about the applicable standard of practice and the failure of the defendants to meet the standard, his opinion was rendered with reasonable medical certainty, and he possessed professional knowledge and expertise coupled with actual knowledge of the applicable community standard to which his expert opinion testimony was addressed.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature finds that the sport of skiing is practiced by a large number of citizens of this state and also attracts a large number of nonresidents, significantly contributing to the economy of Idaho. Since it is recognized that there are inherent risks in the sport of skiing which should be understood by each skier and which are essentially impossible to eliminate by the ski area operation, it is the purpose of this chapter to define those areas of responsibility and affirmative acts for which ski area operators shall be liable for loss, damage or injury, and to define those risks which the skier expressly assumes and for which there can be no recovery.

        In conducting training sessions, the defendant foundation did not have the responsibility to fulfill the duties under this section; the mere fact that the defendant foundation set up the course within the ski area did not make them a “ski operator.” By setting up the course the defendant foundation was not engaged in any duties or activities of a “ski area operator.” By making use of the ski area for training, defendant foundation did not exercise “operational responsibility” for the ski area, and the court correctly denied defendant’s summary judgment on that basis.

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is recognized that skiing as a recreational sport is hazardous to skiers, regardless of all feasible safety measures that can be taken.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each skier expressly assumes the risk of and legal responsibility for any injury to person or property that results from participation in the sport of skiing including any injury caused by the following, all whether above or below snow surface: variations in terrain; any movement of snow including, but not limited to, slides, sloughs or avalanches; any depths of snow, including tree wells, or any accumulations of snow, whether natural or man made, including snowmaking mounds; freestyle terrain; surface or subsurface snow or ice conditions; bare spots, rocks, trees, other forms of forest growth or debris, lift towers and components thereof; utility poles, and snowmaking and snowgrooming equipment which is plainly visible or plainly marked in accordance with the provisions of section 6-1103, Idaho Code. Therefore, each skier shall have the sole individual responsibility for knowing the range of his own ability to negotiate any slope or trail, and it shall be the duty of each skier to ski within the limits of the skier’s own ability, to maintain reasonable control of speed and course at all times while skiing, to heed all posted warnings, to ski only on a skiing area designated by the ski area operator and to refrain from acting in a manner which may cause or contribute to the injury of anyone. The responsibility for collisions by any skier while actually skiing, with any person, shall be solely that of the individual or individuals involved in such collision and not that of the ski area operator.
     </p>
     <p>
      No person shall place any object in the skiing area or on the uphill track of any aerial passenger tramway that may cause a passenger or skier to fall; cross the track of any T-bar lift, J-bar lift, platter lift or similar device, a fiber rope or wire rope tow and a conveyor, except at a designated location; or depart when involved in a skiing accident, from the scene of the accident without leaving personal identification, including name and address, before notifying the proper authorities or obtaining assistance when that person knows that any other person involved in the accident is in need of medical or other assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      No skier shall fail to wear retention straps or other devices to help prevent runaway equipment.

    If a ski area operator has no duty to accomplish any activity undertaken in an attempt to eliminate, alter, control or lessen the inherent risks of skiing and if the duties described in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c11s6-1103" target="_blank">§§ 6-1103 </a></cite>and 6-1104 are the only duties an operator has with regard to the inherent risks of skiing, then it necessarily follows that any activity of an operator to fulfill those duties may not be held to be negligence, since the operator had no duty to accomplish the activity to any standard of care.

     <p>
      Every year, in rapidly increasing numbers, the inhabitants of the state of Idaho and nonresidents are enjoying the recreational value of Idaho’s mountains, rivers, and streams, many of which are remote and far removed for ordinary auto travel. The tourist trade is of vital importance to the state of Idaho, and the services offered by licensed outfitters and guides significantly contribute to the economy of the state of Idaho. The legislature recognizes that there are inherent risks in the recreational activities provided by outfitters which should be understood by each participant. These risks are essentially impossible to eliminate by outfitters and guides. It is the purpose of this chapter to define those areas of responsibility and affirmative acts for which outfitters and guides shall be liable for loss, damage, or injury, and to define those risks which the participant expressly assumes and for which there can be no recovery.

        Chapters 93 and 225 of S.L. 1980 each purported to enact a new chapter 13 in title 6. Accordingly, chapter 93 was codified as title 6, chapter 13 (§§ 6-1301, 6-1302) while chapter 225 was codified as title 6, chapter 14 through the use of brackets. The redesignation of the sections enacted by S.L. 1980, ch. 225 was made permanent by S.L. 2005, ch. 25.

        Based on the parties’ express agreement and the degree of distribution company’s involvement in the actual production of the product for distribution in this country, there was substantial, competent evidence in the record to support the trial court’s finding that distribution company held itself out as a manufacturer; trial court did not err in imputing distribution company’s liability to retailer.

        The determination of whether a company was subject to strict liability as a product seller who remanufactured a product before it was sold to the user or consumer was dependent upon disputed facts, including whether company held itself out as a manufacturer and/or a product seller, whether company remanufactured or serviced other parts of the machine, the extent of the remanufacturing or servicing done to the engine, how the engine ultimately arrived in the hands of the final user, and the extent to which the company altered the engine before it was sold.

        When an employee of a wholesale seed distributor was fatally injured while working at a picking table that was fabricated by another employee and installed to allow employees to sort seeds more efficiently, the distributor was not a manufacturer of the picking table for product liability purposes, because the table was neither a product, nor a component part of a product. The picking table was not produced for introduction into trade or commerce, nor was it sold for integration into other products. Gomez v. Crookham Co., — Idaho —, 457 P.3d 901 (2020).

       <p>
        Subsection (2)(a) establishes a presumption that the useful safe life of all products expires ten years after the date of delivery. Thus, a product seller need only show that the harm was caused more than ten years after the date of delivery and it will be presumed that the harm occurred after the product’s useful safe life, and that the product seller is immune from liability.

        The burden of proof is on the products liability plaintiff to rebut by clear and convincing evidence the presumption that the product’s useful safe life expired after ten years and show that the harm was actually caused before the product’s useful safe life expired. Rebuttal of the presumed ten-year period of repose by clear and convincing evidence is not the only method provided for plaintiffs to avoid the effects of the statute of repose; subsection (2)(b) of this section sets forth a number of limitations which, if shown by the plaintiff, preclude application of the presumptive ten-year period of repose.

        It is clear that the Idaho Product Liability Reform Act allows the defense of assumption of the risk and product misuse as a component of comparative negligence; such issues should be discussed in terms of contributory negligence, not assumption of risk, and applied accordingly under comparative negligence laws.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The trial court’s instructions to the jury included instructions concerning defendant’s general affirmative defense that plaintiff acted negligently and failed to use ordinary care for his own safety; although the instructions to the jury did not use the words “assumption of the risk” or “misuse,” the jury instructions given adequately explained plaintiff’s duty of due care and defendant’s defense of comparative responsibility. Watson v. Navistar Int’l Transp. Corp., 121 Idaho 643, 827 P.2d 656 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant requested an instruction that defined product misuse as the failure to follow directions and warnings provided by the seller but the user’s failure to follow directions was another aspect of comparative responsibility encompassed by the court’s given instructions, it was not error for the trial court to refuse the requested instruction. Watson v. Navistar Int’l Transp. Corp., 121 Idaho 643, 827 P.2d 656 (1992).
    Although it was clear that both jury instruction nos. 17 and 19 contained language concerning defendant/manufacturer’s duty of care, this repetition was not prejudicial; instruction no. 19 stated the duty of care of both parties fully while instruction no. 17 repeated the duty of care for the manufacturer. Any undue prominence given by this instruction was offset by given instruction no. 9 which defined negligence as the failure to use the ordinary care that a “reasonable careful person would use under circumstances similar to those shown” by the evidence. Watson v. Navistar Int’l Transp. Corp., 121 Idaho 643, 827 P.2d 656 (1992).

        Genuine issues of fact remained as to the defectiveness of warnings and the grain auger covers, and as to whether the alteration of the covers, as compared to the design of the covers, proximately caused plaintiff’s injuries; thus, granting of summary judgment was vacated.

       <p>
        Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to plaintiff/farmer injured in combine, the court could not hold as a matter of law whether a better warning decal or whether appropriate safety information in the owner’s manual may have deterred or prevented plaintiff’s actions; therefore, rather than second-guess the jury’s determination of proximate cause from failure to warn, the Idaho supreme court affirmed the trial judge’s decision denying defendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The trial court’s instructions to the jury included instructions concerning defendant’s general affirmative defense that plaintiff acted negligently and failed to use ordinary care for his own safety. Although the instructions to the jury did not use the words “assumption of the risk” or “misuse,” the jury instructions given adequately explained plaintiff’s duty of due care and defendant’s defense of comparative responsibility; accordingly, there was no error. Watson v. Navistar Int’l Transp. Corp., 121 Idaho 643, 827 P.2d 656 (1992).

        Where defendant requested an instruction that defined product misuse as the failure to follow directions and warnings provided by the seller but the user’s failure to follow directions was another aspect of comparative responsibility encompassed by the court’s given instructions, it was not error for the trial court to refuse the requested instruction.

        In light of the adoption of comparative negligence in Idaho, the adequacy of a warning is a factor to be considered and determined by the jury. Where there is substantial competent evidence that a manufacturer may have inadequately warned potential users of a danger or defect, the user’s percentage of comparative negligence will determine the reduction in the plaintiff’s damages to the extent that the plaintiff did not act as an ordinary reasonably prudent person under the circumstances.

        The language in subdivision (4)(a) of this section creates a jury question, unless the court is able to rule as a matter of law that the facts are undisputed and lead to one reasonable conclusion; since reasonable minds could find that facilitating removal of covers on grain auger to better load grain and forestall further mangling of covers was reasonably anticipated conduct, summary disposition of the case was incorrect.

        Standard of Duty to Warn.
       </h5>
       <p>
        It is clear that this section incorporates the doctrine of open and obvious danger as a component part of the comparative negligence theory and adopts the objective standard of duty to warn to the “ordinary reasonably prudent person;” an objective standard makes non-dispositive an inquiry into the subjective knowledge of the user. As a policy matter, the standard is used to determine whether the danger involved is so obvious that it is unreasonable to impose on the manufacturer a duty to warn; as a result, a product with a danger that is obvious to a particular user may not entirely relieve the manufacturer of a duty to warn of that danger or defect. Instead, it will simply be one of the factors that the jury may consider after being instructed to consider the obviousness of the danger in determining the degree of negligence. Watson v. Navistar Int’l Transp. Corp., 121 Idaho 643, 827 P.2d 656 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff presented evidence that there was an inadequate “caution” decal on a combine and that a “danger” symbol and a graphical decal showing a person’s leg caught in an auger should have been used and the plaintiff offered further evidence that the operator’s manual failed to indicate that the combine should be adjusted for grass seed harvesting, construing all of the evidence in favor of plaintiff as the court is required to do, the court could not hold as a matter of law that the danger imposed by the auger was so plain, open and obvious that it precluded a duty to warn. Watson v. Navistar Int’l Transp. Corp., 121 Idaho 643, 827 P.2d 656 (1992).

       <p>
        Where the plaintiff placed a ladder on a wet concrete floor, propping it against the rounded surface of a boiler, and where he stood on the unsecured ladder at a point above where it made contact with the boiler, the dangers involved in his use of the ladder were so obvious that imposing a duty on the defendants to warn would have served no function, and the trial court properly granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the claim relating to failure to warn.

        If it appears that a party is seeking the introduction of evidence of subsequent remedial measures to imply culpability under the guise of impeachment or any other purpose, certainly the trial court should disallow the evidence; however, the trial court is in the best position to assess the prejudicial effect of the evidence. If the trial court is satisfied that the evidence has substantial probative value on the issue on which it is introduced and that the issue is genuinely in dispute, it should be allowed and a limiting instruction can aid the jury, but if the trial court concludes that factors of undue prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury or a waste of time outweigh the probative value of the evidence, it should properly be excluded.

       <p>
        Damages may be recovered in a wrongful death case, even though they are not tied to a financial or pecuniary loss, as such a loss is presumed with respect to loss of society or companionship. It does not mean that if a plaintiff seeks special, or out-of-pocket, damages, there is no need to prove them with any specificity or tie them to a particular loss. Horner v. Sani-Top, Inc., 143 Idaho 230, 141 P.3d 1099 (2006).
    In order for an award of special damages to be upheld, the plaintiff must put on some type of proof to support the damage award; compensatory awards based on speculation and conjecture will not be allowed. When considering an award of damages for future losses, the question is whether the plaintiff has proven the damages with reasonable certainty. Horner v. Sani-Top, Inc., 143 Idaho 230, 141 P.3d 1099 (2006).

        Punitive damages are reserved for the most unusual and compelling circumstances; the reason for the disfavor with regard to awarding punitive damages is the emphasis on punishment and deterrence rather than compensation of plaintiff, which is the normal role for a civil action.

       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court committed an error of law by choosing to use the defendant’s proposed jury instructions, rather than the pattern instructions, where the instructions given failed to instruct the jury that punitive damages are intended to take account of a defendant’s egregious actions and punish him accordingly and where the instructions were a misstatement of state law and punitive damages law in general. Schaefer v. Ready, 134 Idaho 378, 3 P.3d 56 (Ct. App. 2000).

In ruling upon such petition the court may consider whether the judgment debtor’s failure to make full or timely payment was the result of his excusable inadvertence or the ministerial act of third parties beyond the control of the judgment debtor, together with all equitable considerations which favor granting or denying the petition.

        Trial court appropriately entered judgment in compliance with this section since not one of the family’s damage awards for noneconomic damages in a wrongful death action for their two-year-old child exceeded the statutory cap, and the court correctly initially applied comparative fault to the total damage award for each family member and then multiplied each damage award by the 13% of fault attributable to the product’s manufacturer. Horner v. Sani-Top, Inc., 143 Idaho 230, 141 P.3d 1099 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        After properly apportioning liability as found by the jury at trial, a court must then determine whether the total noneconomic damage award for a particular plaintiff exceeds the cap. If so, the court should further reduce each defendant’s responsibility on a proportional basis, based upon the jury’s allocation of fault so the plaintiff’s total judgment does not exceed the cap. Horner v. Sani-Top, Inc., 143 Idaho 230, 141 P.3d 1099 (2006).

       <p>
        In a tort action filed by plaintiff tenant who fell down the stairs of the leased premises, sufficient evidence showed defendant landlord engaged in willful and wanton misconduct and, therefore, this section’s limit on noneconomic damages did not apply. The landlord knew that the steps had deteriorated to the point that they constituted a hazard, improperly repaired the treads by using brackets of the wrong size, and was warned by another tenant that the stairs treads were loose. Phillips v. Erhart, 151 Idaho 100, 254 P.3d 1 (2011).

        In a personal injury action arising out of a car accident that occurred when a student was taking lessons from a school driving instructor, the school was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue of the instructor’s recklessness. The limitation on non-economic damages in this section did not apply because the instructor told the student to execute a three-point turn when the weather and road conditions were poor, and it was twilight.

        This section does not violate the right to jury trial as guaranteed by Article I, § 7 of the Idaho Constitution; does not constitute special legislation in violation of Article III, § 19 of the Idaho Constitution; and does not violate the separation of powers doctrine embodied in Article II, § 1 and Article V, § 13 of the Idaho Constitution.

        Because the state has a legitimate interest in protecting the availability of liability insurance for Idaho citizens, and this section is neither an arbitrary, capricious, nor unreasonable method for addressing this legitimate societal concern, this section does not violate the constitutional prohibition against special legislation. Kirkland ex rel. Kirkland v. Blain County Med. Ctr., 134 Idaho 464, 4 P.3d 1115 (2000). In General.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the legislature has the power to modify or repeal common law causes of action, and consistent with this power, the legislature has limited, and/or eliminated, the liability of defendants in certain personal injury cases and has enacted statutes of limitation and repose which can effectively prevent plaintiffs from recovering damages in personal injury cases, there is no logical reason why a statutory limitation on a plaintiff’s remedy as imposed by this section is any different than other permissible limitations on the ability of plaintiffs to recover in tort actions.

        As a matter of law, the statutory cap in this section is the maximum “value” of a claim for noneconomic damages. State Dep’t of Health & Welfare v.

        This section provides no indication that the legislature was concerned with out-of-court settlements or that these should be taken into consideration when applying the cap: regardless of how many defendants are listed on the verdict form or how many actions the claimant brings to collect damages, ultimately, a judgment cannot be entered in favor of “a claimant” that exceeds the amount of the statutory cap.

        District court properly denied judgment as a matter of law and submitted the issue of reckless or willful conduct under this section to the jury because conflicting inferences on the issue of foreseeability could be drawn from the facts. Kuntz v. Lamar Corp., 385 F.3d 1177 (9th Cir. 2004).

        This section does not require the jury to find that the defendant subjectively knew of a high probability of harm. Phillips v. Erhart, 151 Idaho 100, 254 P.3d 1 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in a negligence action in permitting a jury to consider whether a tire company’s conduct was reckless; the allegations placed the company on notice that its conduct might have involved a heightened degree of negligence and that it, therefore, faced potential liability in excess of the cap on noneconomic damages in subsection (1).

       </p>
       <p>
        Objective, “should-have-known” standard is the appropriate standard of recklessness under this section.

       In all civil actions in which punitive damages are permitted, no claim for damages shall be filed containing a prayer for relief seeking punitive damages. However, a party may, pursuant to a pretrial motion and after hearing before the court, amend the pleadings to include a prayer for relief seeking punitive damages. The court shall allow the motion to amend the pleadings if, after weighing the evidence presented, the court concludes that, the moving party has established at such hearing a reasonable likelihood of proving facts at trial sufficient to support an award of punitive damages. A prayer for relief added pursuant to this section shall not be barred by lapse of time under any applicable limitation on the time in which an action may be brought or claim asserted, if the time prescribed or limited had not expired when the original pleading was filed.

        In an insurance action, plaintiff’s motion to amend the complaint to include a claim for punitive damages pursuant to subsection (2) was granted, because defendant insurance company knew that the insured was a covered insured at the commencement of the claims litigation and prevented the insured from learning that information. The totality of the evidence presented by the plaintiff in its motion to amend would support a jury verdict for punitive damages. United Heritage Prop. & Cas. Co. v. Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins.

        District court did not err in holding that the insureds were not entitled to amend their complaint to assert a claim for punitive damages, where they did not show that the district court perceived the issue of non-payment as anything other than an exercise of discretion, or that it violated a legal standard.

    Given the facts in a fraud case, an award of $250,000 in punitive damages was unconstitutional. Punitive damages in the amount of $100,000, approximately a ratio of 6:1 to the $17,000 damges awarded on the fraud charge, is all that is constitutionally permissible. Alexander v.

        Nominal damages to a landowner who was prevented from accessing his property by an easement across a neighbor’s property, where the neighbor erected a locked gate across the easement road, supported a punitive damages award because overwhelming evidence showed that the neighbor was aware of the easement.

        Punitive damage award of $93,498, though a significant portion of defendant’s assets, was not excessive in light of defendant’s dishonest conduct and its status as a bonded warehouse; the award was not disproportionate to the compensatory damages and could deter similar conduct.

        In a commercial lease dispute, punitive damages were proper because defendants decided to terminate the lease prior to the expiration, based on circumstances they contrived, and they acted in a manner that was malicious or outrageous. Gunter v. Murphy’s Lounge, L.L.C., 141 Idaho 16, 105 P.3d 676 (2005).

        Where the member of a limited liability company and an employee wrongfully diverted jobs from the company and used its employees and equipment to perform those jobs, the company filed a claim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. The district court abused its discretion in denying the company’s motion to amend its pleadings to add claims for punitive damages without conducting the analysis required by this section. Todd v.

        Punitive damages may not be awarded based on simple negligence, but instead depend on whether the plaintiff is able to establish the requisite intersection of two factors: a bad act and a bad state of mind. United Heritage Prop. & Cas. Co. v. Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17592 (D. Idaho Feb. 9, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        To justify punitive damages, a defendant must have: (1) acted in a manner that was an extreme deviation from reasonable standards of conduct, with an understanding of or disregard for its likely consequences, and (2) acted with an extremely harmful state of mind, whether that be termed malice, oppression, fraud or gross negligence; malice, oppression, wantonness; or simply deliberate or willful. Burks v. Bailey (In re Bailey), 499 B.R. 873 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2013).
    Trial court did not err in awarding punitive damages to respondents in their action for trespass, as the record showed that one appellant consciously disregarded a permanent injunction when he knowingly trespassed on respondents’ property at night, 30 feet from their home, in an effort to frighten and intimidate one respondent. Akers v. D.L. White Constr., Inc., 156 Idaho 37, 320 P.3d 428 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party seeking to recover for punitive damages must prove by clear and convincing evidence oppressive, fraudulent, malicious or outrageous conduct by the party against whom the claim for punitive damages is asserted. In addition to oppressive behavior in a business context, five factors must be considered in deciding whether there is substantial evidence of an extreme deviation from standards of reasonable conduct: (1) the presence of expert testimony; (2) whether the unreasonable conduct actually caused harm to the plaintiff; (3) whether there is a special relationship between the parties; (4) proof of a continuing course of oppressive conduct; and (5) proof of the actor’s knowledge of the likely consequences of the conduct.

        The district judge did not abuse his discretion by denying plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages where defendant failed to establish a reasonable likelihood he could prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that plaintiff acted oppressively, fraudulently, wantonly, maliciously or outrageously. Weaver v. Stafford, 134 Idaho 691, 8 P.3d 1234 (2000), overruled on other grounds, Weitz v. Green, 148 Idaho 851, 230 P.3d 743 (2010).

        Injured customer’s motion to add punitive damages was properly granted because the amended complaint put the store on notice of the customer’s claim for punitive damages and it sufficiently alleged that the store’s failure to train employees in safe display techniques was an extreme deviation from industry practice, which was sufficient to establish a “reasonable likelihood” of proving facts at trial to support a punitive damages award. Vendelin v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 140 Idaho 416, 95 P.3d 34 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Buyer, who alleged that insulation was defective and that its seller breached an agreement to reimburse the buyer for repairs, met the “reasonable likelihood” standard, and was entitled to amend its complaint to include a claim for punitive damages. A statement by the seller’s product manager that the seller didn’t care because the insulation business was being sold, the seller’s failure to inspect the buildings containing the insulation, and its knowledge of past insulation shrinkage problems elsewhere raised a reasonable inference that the seller was not acting in good faith in withholding reimbursement, but instead was stiffing the buyer while reaping the benefits of the repairs. Hansen-Rice, Inc. v. Celotex Corp., 414 F. Supp. 2d 970 (D. Idaho 2006).

       <p>
        Conduct justifying punitive damages requires an intersection of two factors: a bad act and a bad state of mind. The defendant must (1) act in a manner that was an extreme deviation from reasonable standards of conduct with an understanding of — or disregard for — its likely consequences, and must (2) act with an extremely harmful state of mind, described variously as with malice, oppression, fraud, gross negligence, wantonness, deliberately, or willfully.

        Where herbicide manufacturer’s conduct does not demonstrate the harmful state of mind necessary to support an award of punitive damages and plaintiff offered no evidence that changes that the manufacturer made to the label of the herbicide were an extreme deviation from industry standards of conduct, plaintiffs were not entitled to amend their complaint to add a claim for punitive damages.

        Calculating 5% of insurance company’s annual profit in arriving at an amount of punitive damages was a reasonable method of determining an appropriate amount for deterrent purposes where facts established deceptive marketing practices and bad faith denial of benefits practices by insurance company which were likely to continue if not deterred.

        The most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s conduct. The second indicium of an unreasonable or excessive punitive damages award is its ratio to the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff. The third indicium is the difference between the punitive damages awarded and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases. Alexander v. Stibal, 161 Idaho 253, 385 P.3d 431 (2016), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 137 S. Ct. 258, 196 L. Ed. 2d 136 (2016).

        District court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that a reasonable likelihood existed that the evidence could support a punitive damages award; regardless, the issue of whether the evidence could support an award of punitive damages was moot, because the jury in fact awarded punitive damages and their decision was supported by competent and substantial, although conflicting, evidence.

        Where plaintiff’s complaint contained a prayer for relief seeking punitive damages and defendants never moved to strike such improper claim, by failing to object defendants waived their right to object, and because the issue was fully tried by the parties, the court should have treated the issue as if it had been properly pled and determined whether an award of punitive damages was proper.

      In any action for personal injury or property damage, a judgment may be entered for the claimant only for damages which exceed amounts received by the claimant from collateral sources as compensation for the personal injury or property damage, whether from private, group or governmental sources, and whether contributory or noncontributory. For the purposes of this section, collateral sources shall not include benefits paid under federal programs which by law must seek subrogation, death benefits paid under life insurance contracts, benefits paid by a service corporation organized under chapter 34, title 41, Idaho Code, and benefits paid which are recoverable under subrogation rights created under Idaho law or by contract. Evidence of payment by collateral sources is admissible to the court after the finder of fact has rendered an award. Such award shall be reduced by the court to the extent the award includes compensation for damages which have been compensated independently from collateral sources.

        In plaintiff’s action to recover damages for personal injuries following a car accident, the district court correctly refused to allow defendant to present evidence to the jury regarding the amounts actually paid to plaintiff’s medical providers.

        In action alleging breach in agreement concerning sale of plaintiff’s share of stock in corporation founded by plaintiff and defendant, to defendant, contrary to plaintiff’s argument that defendant was not entitled to attorney’s fees since she did not incur any liability as corporation incurred the liability for her attorney’s fees and to award them to her would result in a windfall to her; the collateral source rule found in this section was inapplicable and further, any arrangement defendant may have made with a third party regarding her attorney’s fees was not relevant to the question of whether she, as a party, is entitled to be compensated for attorney’s fees incurred in defending against the complaint. Hines v. Hines, 129 Idaho 847, 934 P.2d 20 (1997). Insurance Payments.
       </p>
       <p>
        In plaintiff’s personal injury suit for damages following an automobile accident, defendant was not entitled to have plaintiff’s jury award reduced by the amount of payments plaintiff received from her insurance company in underinsured motorist benefits. This section provides that collateral sources shall not include benefits paid which are recoverable under subrogation rights under Idaho law or by contract. Whether or not the insurance company seeks recovery from plaintiff as it is entitled under the insurance policy is a contractual matter between plaintiff and the insurance company. Dyet v. McKinley, 139 Idaho 526, 81 P.3d 1236 (2003), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in reducing a damage award by the amount paid out by an insurance company. Pursuant to this section, the court was required to reduce the damage award by the amount paid by the defendant’s insurance company in order to avoid double recovery by the plaintiff. McCandless v. Pease, — Idaho —, 465 P.3d 1104 (2020).

       <p>
        In plaintiff’s action to recover damages for personal injuries from a car accident, the district court correctly determined that evidence of Medicare write-offs was inadmissible. By treating a Medicare write-off as a collateral source, the danger of prejudice is avoided, and the jury will not be influenced by the existence of Medicare. Dyet v. McKinley, 139 Idaho 526, 81 P.3d 1236 (2003), overruled on other grounds, Verska v. St. Alphonsus Med. Ctr., 151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011).

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of payment by collateral sources is admissible to a court after the finder of fact has rendered an award. Such award shall be reduced by the court to the extent the award includes compensation for damages, which have been compensated independently from collateral sources, like Medicare. Eldridge v. West, — Idaho —, 458 P.3d 172 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in concluding that Medicare write-offs had to be subtracted from invoices prior to their submission to the jury for a determination of damages. The jury should be provided with the medical care providers’ bills that were subject to any write-offs, absent those write-offs: if a verdict is rendered that includes those amounts, such award should be reduced by the court.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t06c16s6-1607ol11">
       No employer shall be directly or indirectly liable in tort based upon an employer/employee relationship for any act or omission of an employee which occurs after the termination of the employee’s employment unless it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the acts or omissions of the employer itself constitute gross negligence or reckless, willful and wanton conduct as those standards are defined in section 6-904C, Idaho Code, and were a proximate cause of the damage sustained.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c16s6-1607ol12">
       There shall be a presumption that an employer is not liable in tort based upon an employer/employee relationship for any act or omission of a current employee unless the employee was wholly or partially engaged in the employer’s business, reasonably appeared to be engaged in the employer’s business, was on the employer’s premises when the allegedly tortious act or omission of the employee occurred, or was otherwise under the direction or control of the employer when the act or omission occurred. This presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence that the employer’s acts or omissions constituted gross negligence or, reckless, willful and wanton conduct as those standards are defined in section 6-904C, Idaho Code, and were a proximate cause of the damage sustained.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c16s6-1607ol13">
       In every civil action to which this section applies, an employer shall have the right (pursuant to pretrial motion and after opportunity for discovery) to a hearing before the court in which the person asserting a claim against an employer must establish a reasonable likelihood of proving facts at trial sufficient to support a finding that liability for damages should be apportioned to the employer under the standards set forth in this section. If the court finds that this standard is not met, the claim against the employer shall be dismissed and the employer shall not be included on a special verdict form.

        Grant of summary judgment in favor of the employer in the employee’s wrongful termination action was proper where his actions were not protected under the Idaho Protection of Public Employees Act,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c21s6-2101" target="_blank">§ 6-2101 </a></cite>et seq.

       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant presented a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge, because the close relation in time between the discovery of the claimant’s documentation of her coworkers’ waste and her termination supported the reasonable inference that the claimant was discharged for that documentation. Curlee v. Kootenai County Fire & Rescue, 148 Idaho 391, 224 P.3d 458 (2008).

       <p>
        Where an employee resigned due to her perception that there was a hostile working environment, after she complained about an inappropriate romantic relationship between her supervisor and another employee, her constructive discharge claim was time barred. Even if she met the evidentiary burden of showing that the circumstances amounted to constructive discharge, she filed her claim more than 180 days after the discharge occurred. Patterson v. State Dep’t of Health & Welfare, 151 Idaho 310, 256 P.3d 718 (2011).

        It was error to grant an employer summary judgment on an employee’s Whistleblower Act claim, because (1) there were fact issues on whether the employee engaged in a protected activity by reporting a building code violation and the employer’s prior knowledge of the issue, and (2) fact issues existed on causation, as it could be concluded that the employee was fired for the report.

Black v. Idaho State Police, 155 Idaho 570, 314 P.3d 625 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is nothing in subsection (2) that requires an investigation to relate to waste or a violation of law, rule, or regulation. The fact that the “waste and violations of law, rule, or regulation” language was left out of subsection (2) suggests that the legislature intended the protections afforded under that subsection to be more broad than those offered under the other subsections of this section. Wright v. Ada Cnty., 160 Idaho 491, 376 P.3d 58 (2016).
    An investigation for purposes of the Idaho Protection of Public Employees Act encompasses any investigation that involves close examination or observation. This is particularly true where the investigation leads to uncovering waste even though the original purpose of the investigation was into something other than waste or a violation of law, rule, or regulation. If no protection were afforded to public employees who participate in official inquiries into subject matter that is unrelated to waste or a violation of law, rule, or regulation, but which subsequently uncover such waste or violations of law, rule, or regulation, the purpose of the act would be wholly defeated. Wright v. Ada Cnty., 160 Idaho 491, 376 P.3d 58 (2016).

        This section provides a whistleblower claimant with an actual damages remedy. “Actual damages” is defined broadly as an amount awarded to a complainant to compensate for a proven injury or loss and is synonymous with compensatory damages, tangible damages, and real damages, including damages for emotional distress. Eller v. Idaho State Police, — Idaho —, 443 P.3d 161 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Noneconomic damages for emotional distress are part of actual damages under this section for two key reasons. First, the Idaho whistleblower act should be interpreted broadly, because it is a remedial statute, providing claimants with a remedy for all actual damages, based on all claims, including those otherwise available under common-law tort claims. Second, case law provides precedent of an expansive interpretation of the term “actual damages.” Smith v. Glenns Ferry Highway Dist., — Idaho —, 462 P.3d 1147 (2020).

        A whistleblower claim is purely a statutory remedy against governmental employers, and there is no reason to assume that the legislature intended those alleging claims under the statute to have to comply with the notice provision of the Idaho Tort Claims Act,<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.06.html#t06c09s6-906" target="_blank">§ 6-906</a></cite>.

     <p>
      Section 1, article IX, of the constitution of the state of Idaho provides: “The stability of a republican form of government depending mainly upon the intelligence of the people, it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.” The purpose of this chapter is to provide a mechanism for adjudicating the performance of that duty when there are allegations that public schools do not provide educational services that they are required to provide as part of a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools. In this chapter, a constitutionally based educational claim is defined as a claim that public schools are not providing educational services that they are required to provide under section 1, article IX, of the constitution of the state of Idaho, and constitutionally required educational services are defined as the educational services that must be provided under section 1, article IX, of the constitution of the state of Idaho. In particular, this chapter provides procedures for adjudicating constitutionally based educational claims and administrative and judicial remedies to be implemented when public schools in a specific local school district are not providing constitutionally required educational services as part of a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools that has been established by the legislature. It is the policy of this chapter whenever possible that constitutionally based educational claims shall be settled locally through consent agreements or plans proposed by local school districts and that state intervention in local school districts be a last resort.

      The legislature has established a system of public, free common schools by its authorization of the creation of or chartering of local school districts. Local school districts are hereby declared to have the primary responsibility for provision of constitutionally required educational services and for assuring themselves and the public that the local school districts are operating their schools as part of a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools. When a local school district is unable to meet its responsibilities under this chapter because it does not provide constitutionally required educational services, this chapter provides judicial and administrative remedies to bring schools operated by the local school district into compliance with section 1, article IX, of the constitution of the state of Idaho and first prescribes local solutions where possible.

       Patron suits against local school districts. Any person who is a schoolchild, the parent or guardian of a schoolchild, or the parent or guardian of a child who will enter public school in the next two (2) years has standing to sue and may bring suit against the local school district in which the schoolchild or potential schoolchild resides on the ground that the local school district is not providing constitutionally required educational services. These complaints may be known as patron complaints, and the persons who are plaintiffs may be known as patrons. The patron complaint must list with specificity the manner in which the patrons contend that the local school district is not providing constitutionally required educational services. No other person, except the state as parens patriae, has standing to bring suit against a school district on the ground that the school district is not providing constitutionally required educational services.

      Upon reaching the merits of the constitutionally based educational claim, the district court shall find whether the defendant local school district is providing all constitutionally required educational services. If the district court shall find that the defendant local school district is providing all constitutionally required educational services, it shall issue a declaratory judgment to that effect. If the district court shall find that the defendant local school district is not providing all constitutionally required educational services, the district court shall then conduct further proceedings as necessary to allow it to make the following findings:

     <ol>
      <li id="t06c22s6-2208ol11">
       The local school district (a) does or does not offer educational or other services that are not constitutionally required, and (b) does or does not offer the constitutionally required educational services that it does offer in a manner that consumes more of the local school district’s resources than necessary to offer the constitutionally required educational services that it does offer.

In making this finding, the district court shall take into account any federal mandates with which the local school district must comply, and the local school district shall not be obligated to redirect its resources from complying with federal mandates.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c22s6-2208ol13">
       The local school district (a) does or does not impose maintenance and operations tax levies, supplemental maintenance and operations tax levies, and school emergency fund levies up to the statutory maximum allowed by law without holding further elections, and (b) does or does not impose maintenance and operations tax levies, supplemental maintenance and operations tax levies, and school emergency fund levies in a total amount that equals or exceeds the sum of the maximum statutory maintenance and operations levy and maximum statutory emergency fund levy plus the simple average of all supplemental maintenance and operations levies of all the local school districts in the state. In making this calculation, the district court may take official notice of publications of the superintendent of public instruction or may by order direct the superintendent of public instruction to supply calculations for the district court’s use.

      When the district court has issued an order over which it has continuing jurisdiction under this chapter, the district court may review as necessary, but not less than annually, the question whether the local school district has complied with its obligation to offer constitutionally required educational services. Upon its review, the district court shall take the following actions:

       If the district court finds that the local school district has at that time complied with its obligation to provide constitutionally required educational services, it shall issue a declaratory judgment to that effect, and it may dissolve any orders previously in place as it finds appropriate.

       If the district court finds that the local school district has not yet complied with its obligations to provide constitutionally required educational services, but is making good faith progress toward compliance with its obligations to provide constitutionally required educational services, it shall issue an interlocutory finding to that effect and continue its jurisdiction.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When authorized by law, the district court, or the state board of education pursuant to section 33-909, Idaho Code, may issue an order for state supervision of a local school district. When an order for state supervision of a local school district is entered by the district court, the superintendent of public instruction shall within thirty-five (35) calendar days appoint, at local school district expense, an officer to be known as a district supervisor. When an order for state supervision of a local school district is entered by the state board of education, the district supervisor shall be appointed pursuant to section 33-909, Idaho Code, at local school district expense. The district supervisor shall have authority to approve or disapprove any actions of the board of the local school district, to supervise or dismiss superintendents, assistant superintendents, and any other district administrative personnel, and to take any actions necessary to further the local school district’s obligations to provide constitutionally required educational services. In the case of appointment by the superintendent of public instruction, the district supervisor shall serve at the pleasure of the superintendent of public instruction until removed by the superintendent of public instruction or the superintendent of public instruction reports to the district court that the local school district is in substantial compliance with its obligations to provide constitutionally required educational services, or until the district court, upon its own motion or upon motion of any of the parties, orders state supervision to end. In the case of appointment by the state board of education, the district supervisor shall serve pursuant to section 33-909, Idaho Code.

        Legislative Findings and Intent
       </h5>
       <p>
        “(1) Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho provides that ‘it shall be the duty of the legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) In the case of
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. Evans
    , 123 Idaho 573 (1993), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the then existing State Board of Education rules for school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case for trial to determine if the system of funding was providing such school facilities, textbooks and curriculum, and transportation systems called for in the rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) In response to that action, the Legislature enacted Section 33-1612, Idaho Code, which defined thoroughness and included ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ among the statutory definitions of thoroughness.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) In a subsequent ruling in the same case,
    Idaho Schools for Equal Educational Opportunity v. State
    , 132 Idaho 559 (1999), the Idaho Supreme Court held that the statutory requirement of ‘a safe environment conducive to learning’ and the rules adopted pursuant to it were consistent with the thoroughness requirements of Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, and that such a safe environment was inherently part of a thorough system of public, free common schools required by Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the district court to determine whether the funding system was providing a safe environment conducive to learning.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) On February 5, 2001, the Fourth Judicial District Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law that the system of school funding then in existence was constitutionally deficient in its ability to repair or replace dangerous or unsafe conditions in school buildings.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(6) On December 21, 2005, on appeal to the Supreme Court, the Idaho Supreme Court affirmed the district court’s February 5, 2001, decision and said:
       </p>
       <p>
        In sum, the evidence in the record clearly supports the district court’s 2001 Findings. We affirm the conclusion of the district court that the current funding system is simply not sufficient to carry out the Legislature’s duty under the constitution. While the Legislature has made laudable efforts to address the safety concerns of various school districts, the task is not yet complete. The appropriate remedy, however, must be fashioned by the Legislature and not this Court. Quite simply, Article IX of our constitution means what it says: “[I]t shall be the duty of the Legislature of Idaho, to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools.” Thus, it is the duty of the State, and not this Court or the local school districts, to meet this constitutional mandate.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(7) In response to the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision, and mindful that the Supreme Court has recognized the Legislature’s efforts, following the district court’s decision in 2001, to provide a system of funding that provides safe schools, it is the purpose of this Act to fulfill the Legislature’s responsibility under Section 1, Article IX, of the Constitution of the state of Idaho, by establishing an ongoing, state-funded system for funding repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities in a manner that fairly and equitably balances the state and local contributions. It requires funds to be dedicated to maintenance to arrest deterioration of schools before they become unsafe.
    “(8) In proposing this Act, it is the intent of the Legislature to:
       </p>
       <p>
        “(a) Amend the statutes addressing the School District Building Account to provide an ongoing means of providing funds from that account for the purpose of assisting school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school facilities; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(b) Remove all artificial limits on the functioning of the bond levy equalization value index. The index measures a school district’s relative ability to pay, and provides a secure, ongoing revenue source for the bond levy equalization program, enabling each school district’s full share of state lottery funds to be used for school building maintenance and repairs; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(c) Establish an ongoing School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program to assist school districts to fund repair or replacement of unsafe school buildings when school districts are unable to fund necessary repair or replacement; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(d) Provide ongoing, fair and equitable state assistance to school districts under the School Facilities Cooperative Funding Program whereby the state initially funds the total cost of repair and replacement that school districts are unable to fund themselves. It creates the necessary taxing authority to pay the school district’s share of the cost of repair or replacement, and establishes a statutory formula to annually determine the school district’s fair and equitable share of the costs of repair or replacement that compares the school district’s bonds and/or plant facilities levy rates to the statewide average bond and/or facility levy rate; and
       </p>
       <p>
        “(e) Require each school district to annually set aside an adequate amount of moneys for the exclusive purpose of school building maintenance in order to arrest deterioration in school facilities that have lead to unsafe conditions and to provide a sliding scale of state match subsidies for this amount based upon the school district’s relative ability to pay.”

        Section 1 of S.L. 2003, ch. 339 read: “Legislative Findings. The Legislature finds that over twelve years of litigation regarding Idaho’s system of school funding has not productively used the state’s resources to ensure that there is a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools. Trial was held in the spring of 2000, but no final judgment or appealable order has been issued and no findings of fact specifying which school districts are unable to provide safe and healthy school facilities under the current system of school financing have been issued. Current proceedings are likely to be even more protracted if a special master is appointed and there is further delay until final judgment, an appealable order, or findings of fact specifying which school districts are unable to provide safe and healthy school facilities under the current system of school financing have been issued. The Legislature therefore determines it can best exercise its constitutional duty to establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public, free common schools by altering the procedure of the existing lawsuit to bring it under the Constitutionally Based Educational Claims Act, which will allow the parties to focus on districts having the most serious health and safety problems, and to provide a remedy of an educational necessity levy or a safe school facility levy as necessary to abate unsafe or unhealthy conditions.”

        The notice provision of subsection (1) does not require claimants to describe alleged defects with excessive particularity. Instead, the “reasonable detail” requirement is satisfied when a claimant provides a builder with enough information to identify the general nature and location of any construction defect.

        District court erred in granting a plumbing subcontractor summary judgment on a negligence claim, where, although the homeowners had not strictly complied with NORA’s notice requirements, the subcontractor had received actual notice of the defective bathtub, had sent an employee to inspect it, and had offered to settle the claim by paying to repair the damage.

      The legislature finds that some residential properties are being contaminated with hazardous chemical residues created by the manufacture of clandestine drugs. Innocent members of the public may be harmed when they are exposed to chemical residues if the residential properties are not decontaminated prior to any subsequent rental, sale or use of the properties. The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and welfare by authorizing the department of health and welfare to establish a program providing a process and standards for the cleanup of clandestine drug laboratories.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature finds that agriculture plays a substantial role in the economy, culture and history of Idaho. As an increasing number of Idahoans are removed from day-to-day agricultural experiences, agritourism provides a valuable opportunity for the general public to interact with, experience and understand agriculture. Inherent risks exist on farms and ranches, the elimination of which would diminish the agritourism experience. Uncertainty of potential liability associated with inherent risks has a negative impact on the establishment and success of agritourism operations.

       </p>
       <p>
        “(1) Under Section 1, Article I, of the Constitution of the State of Idaho, ‘acquiring, possessing and protecting property’ is an inalienable right. The right to own real property and to exclude others from that property according to law is fundamental to our rights as citizens and has been upheld repeatedly by the United States Supreme Court.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(2) Section 23, Article I of the Idaho Constitution also protects the right to hunt and fish, but that right expressly does not include ‘a right to trespass on private property.’
       </p>
       <p>
        “(3) The Legislature finds that trespassing on private property has become a serious problem for landowners throughout the state. While many individuals respect private property rights, landowners report a significant number of persons who blatantly disregard the rights of property owners and frequently cause damage to private property, including cut fences, ruined crops, vandalism and theft.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(4) The trespass laws of the State of Idaho have been insufficient to deter trespassing and have offered inadequate penalties when trespassers are prosecuted.
       </p>
       <p>
        “(5) Moreover, the existing trespass laws are a confusing, inconsistent and constitutionally suspect patchwork of laws. They impose significant posting burdens on landowners, without reducing trespassing. The poor construction of the laws of trespass hinders the effective arrest and prosecution of trespassers.
       </p>
       <p>

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature finds that the sport of bicycling is practiced by a large number of citizens of this state at mountain areas and also attracts a large number of nonresidents, significantly contributing to the economy of Idaho. Since it is recognized that there are inherent risks in the sport of bicycling that should be understood by each bicyclist and that are essentially impossible to eliminate by the mountain operators, it is the purpose of this chapter to define those areas of responsibility and affirmative acts for which mountain operators shall be liable for loss, damage, or injury and to define those risks that the bicyclist expressly assumes and for which there can be no recovery. Nothing in this chapter shall impact other defenses that may be raised by mountain operators against claims asserted by bicyclist.
