       <p>
        When the Constitution was adopted, jurisdiction was therein granted to the supreme court to issue the writ of certiorari then known and in use in the territory of Idaho, and none other. Neil v. Public Utils. Comm’n, 32 Idaho 44, 178 P. 271 (1919).

        Habeas Corpus.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Upon application for writ of habeas corpus, the supreme court will not exercise the jurisdiction of an appellate court for the examination of questions reviewable on appeal. In re Knudtson, 10 Idaho 676, 79 P. 641 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court may make a writ of habeas corpus issued by it returnable before any district court. Jain v. Priest, 30 Idaho 273, 164 P. 364 (1917).
    The supreme court may take original jurisdiction of an action involving the custody of a child. Jain v. Priest, 30 Idaho 273, 164 P. 364 (1917); Allen v. Williams, 31 Idaho 309, 171 P. 493 (1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where application is made to a district court for a writ of habeas corpus involving the custody of a child, the petitioner can not abandon the proceeding thus initiated and institute a new one in the supreme court, original in character. Allen v. Williams, 31 Idaho 309, 171 P. 493 (1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        In habeas corpus proceeding in federal district court where state prisoners had filed motions for new trial subsequent to conviction and had appealed to state supreme court where convictions were affirmed and prisoners had not exhausted the remedy of habeas corpus to the state supreme court, federal court assumed jurisdiction to determine petitions raising only the issues previously presented to the state district and supreme courts on the basis that there had been a practical exhaustion of state remedies and a different result appeared unlikely in the state courts. Drapeau v. May, 350 F. Supp. 1321 (D. Idaho 1972).

      </div>
      <div>
       <h5 id="t01c02s1-203-CASENOTES-mandamus">
        Mandamus.
       </h5>
       <p>
        A court, by means of writs of mandamus operating upon the officers of legislative bodies, cannot make up the records of the proceedings of these bodies, or cause alterations to be made in such records as prepared by the officer whose duty it was to prepare them. Clough v. Curtis, 134 U.S. 361, 10 S. Ct. 573, 33 L. Ed. 945 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mandamus will not lie at the instance of the speaker of the house of representatives to require the secretary of the territory to deliver to him the journal of the house for correction after the adjournment of the session. Burkhart v. Reed, 2 Idaho 503, 22 P. 1 (1889), aff’d, Clough v. Curtis, 134 U.S. 361, 10 S. Ct. 573, 33 L. Ed. 945 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not within the scope of mandamus to confer power upon those to whom it is directed; it only enforces the exercise of power already existing when such exercise is a duty; therefore, the supreme court cannot, by writ of mandamus, require the territorial secretary to determine from the evidence what are the correct minutes of the legislature and to expunge certain matter from those minutes. Clough v. Curtis, 2 Idaho 523, 22 P. 8 (1889), aff’d, 134 U.S. 361, 10 S. Ct. 573, 33 L. Ed. 945 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of mandate is the proper proceeding to compel the secretary of state to file and certify a ticket entitled to be filed and certified. Williams v. Lewis, 6 Idaho 184, 54 P. 619 (1898), overruled on other grounds, Stein v. Morrison, 9 Idaho 426, 75 P. 246 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where application for declaratory judgment in mandamus was initiated to compel secretary of state to file petitioner’s declaration of candidacy, the supreme court, in determining its jurisdiction to hear and decide the case, is only concerned with whether the action belongs to that class of cases of which supreme court has original jurisdiction. Boughton v. Price, 70 Idaho 243, 215 P.2d 286 (1950).

        Prohibition as authorized by the Idaho Constitution, is the common law writ and it will not issue to prohibit purely ministerial acts. Stein v. Morrison, 9 Idaho 426, 75 P. 246 (1904); Taylor v. Girard, 54 Idaho 787, 36 P.2d 773 (1934).

        Writ of prohibition is not available unless there is no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law; however, in a proper case, the supreme court has the authority to issue such a writ.

        The allowance of an appeal from an order awarding the plaintiff in a divorce suit alimony for support pending her divorce would, in many instances, defeat the object and purpose of the statute allowing temporary alimony. Wyatt v. Wyatt, 2 Idaho 236, 10 P. 228 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order of district court refusing to bring in additional parties, not being a final judgment, was not appealable. Weiser Irrigation Dist. v. Middle Valley Irrigation Ditch Co., 28 Idaho 548, 155 P. 484 (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal from order that denied defendant’s motion for a summary judgment is not authorized by the legislature, which is constitutionally authorized to prescribe a system of appeals; thus, such order was not appealable. Wilson v. DeBoard, 94 Idaho 562, 494 P.2d 566 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Post-conviction petitioner’s notice of appeal from a district court’s notice of intent to dismiss, though premature and interlocutory in nature, was nevertheless sufficient to effectuate an appeal from a final order dismissing the petition four days after the petitioner’s notice of appeal was filed.

Work v. Kinney, 8 Idaho 771, 71 P. 477 (1902).
    Although supreme court, in considering an appeal, grants a new trial on one assignment of error, it is proper for the court to consider other assignments of error which are necessary to the final determination of the case. State v. Ash, 94 Idaho 542, 493 P.2d 701 (1972).

        Where the court reversed defendant’s conviction for illegal possession of controlled substances on the ground that the search warrant did not describe the place to be searched with particularity, the court properly considered other questions of law pertaining to the issuance of the search warrant which could arise on retrial.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court found that no use tax return had been filed as to property used by a building contractor on a construction project, the supreme court properly considered the issue of whether part of an asserted deficiency in use tax payments was barred by the statute of limitations notwithstanding the tax commission’s contention that the trial court made no ruling on the effect of the statute of limitations.

        Judgment based upon verdict of guilty and infliction of death penalty by jury is decision or judgment within meaning of this section. State v. Ramirez, 34 Idaho 623, 203 P. 279 (1921).
    Reversal of judgment, with directions to enter judgment for appellant, was a final adjudication, and an order granting a new trial after remittitur was improper. Smith v. Canyon County Consol. School Dist. No. 34, 44 Idaho 187, 255 P. 642 (1927).

        An order withholding sentence and placing a defendant on probation is not a final judgment since sentencing is deferred and is distinguishable from a judgment imposing sentence, which is a final judgment, though its execution is suspended.

        Where final judgment or order of the lower tribunal is correct, but entered upon an incorrect theory, the judgment or order may be affirmed by the appellate court upon the correct theory. Layrite Prods. Co. v. Lux, 91 Idaho 110, 416 P.2d 501 (1966).

        Subdivision (e) of Idaho App. R. 17 and this section are parallel provisions and both serve the ends of judicial economy; both contemplate that if there is a final appealable order before the supreme court, the court should resolve all interlocutory issues which have been passed upon by the trial court so that possibly another appeal will be avoided. Hence, although an order declaring part of decedent’s property as separate or community was not normally an appealable order, the court addressed this issue where the magistrate court’s order that the decedent’s husband was not an omitted spouse was appealed.

       <p>
        Although failure of the trial court to submit to the jury the issue and law as to sudden peril was not specifically and separately assigned by appellants as error, since it does have a direct bearing on the issue of negligence on the part of a truck driver and since it is necessarily involved in the consideration of such negligence which is an assigned error, and was an issue which was likely to arise upon a new trial, the supreme court deemed it proper to discuss the issue. Barry v. Arrow Transp. Co., 80 Idaho 447, 333 P.2d 1008 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        In disposing of an appeal by granting a new trial, supreme court should determine questions of law which may be necessary for the final determination of the case. Ore-Ida Potato Prods., Inc. v. United Pac. Ins. Co., 87 Idaho 185, 392 P.2d 191 (1964); Cassia Creek Reservoir Co. v. Harper, 91 Idaho 488, 426 P.2d 209 (1967).

       <p>
        Where a case involving sports arena owner’s action against building contractor and architect to recover for damage to sports arena’s artificial turf was to be reversed and remanded, the supreme court was required to confront question raised on appeal regarding the res judicata effect of the summary judgment entered in favor of the architect on the liability of building contractor who asserted as a defense that the architect’s negligence was the cause of the damage. Idaho State Univ. v. Mitchell, 97 Idaho 724, 552 P.2d 776 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires the supreme court, when remanding a case for further proceedings, to pass upon and determine all the questions of law involved in the case presented upon such appeal and the fact that an issue decided is not specifically and separately assigned by the parties as error does not alter this duty. Neilsen & Co. v. Cassia & Twin Falls County Joint Class A School Dist. 151, 103 Idaho 317, 647 P.2d 773 (Ct. App. 1982); Idaho Power Co. v. State, 104 Idaho 751, 661 P.2d 741 (1983); Olson v.

    This section allows the supreme court to decide all the issues in a remanded case that will be necessary for the final determination of the case, even though an issue so decided is not specifically and separately assigned by the parties as error. Keeven v. Wakley, 110 Idaho 452, 716 P.2d 1224 (1986).

        This section should be liberally construed and authorizes the supreme court, on affirming a decision of the trial court sustaining a demurrer, to set aside the judgment of that court dismissing the action in order to afford plaintiff an opportunity to amend, or to direct that court to issue a temporary restraining order.

        Absent legislative direction, the supreme court not only has the authority, but the duty, to adopt procedure designed to safeguard the rights of an accused to a fair and impartial trial. State v. Johnson, 86 Idaho 51, 383 P.2d 326 (1963).

        Since the supreme court has the inherent power to promulgate procedural rules, it follows that the court also has the inherent power to establish rules of evidence, including a rule which allows a criminal defendant to be impeached by the use of a prior felony conviction.

     <p>
      The Supreme Court of the state of Idaho may, at any time, appoint from among the duly elected, qualified and acting district judges of the state of Idaho, from any of the various counties or districts, one or more of such judges to act for such period of time as may be designated in the order appointing them, as commissioners of the Supreme Court; and upon grounds of the public service, the personnel of such commission may be changed from time to time as necessities and business of the several districts may require, by the designation of other district judges to act in the place and stead of those first designated. All that shall be legally required to constitute such commission, and authorize each commissioner to act, shall be the making and entering by the Supreme Court of the order of appointment or substitution of such commissioners. It shall be the duty of said commissioners, under such rules and regulations as the court may adopt, to assist the Supreme Court in the performance of its duties and the disposition of the numerous causes now or hereafter pending in said court, and undetermined. None of such district judges shall be qualified to act for a longer period than that for which they were elected or appointed to serve in the capacity of district judges. None of such commissioners shall receive any salary or emolument whatsoever in addition to the salary already prescribed for them by law, but each and all shall be entitled to and be paid all actual and necessary expenses incurred by him in the performance of his duties hereunder, including when absent from the city of his residence, but not otherwise, actual and necessary expenses of travel and sustenance, all of which expenses shall be paid from the treasury of the state of Idaho in the same manner as are similar expenses of the justices of the Supreme Court, but out of the appropriation made for such purposes for district judges. The Supreme Court shall have the power to remove or substitute any or all members of said commission at any time, permanently or temporarily, and vacancies arising from any cause shall be filled by the Supreme Court. Before entering upon the discharge of their duties, each commissioner will be required to take and subscribe the constitutional oath of office.

       <p>
        Where on an appeal from a justice court to a district court, the latter is improperly designated, unless it is shown to have misled or deceived the opposite party, the appeal will not be dismissed. Darling v. Fremstadt, 22 Idaho 684, 127 P. 674 (1912). Presumption Attaching to Proceedings of Court of General Jurisdiction.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule as to the verity attaching to proceedings of a court of record or a court of general jurisdiction is inapplicable to a case where an officer seeks to justify a levy upon property under a writ of execution or attachment when the property is claimed by a stranger to the writ; then nothing is presumed and everything must be proved; in case of an attachment, the indebtedness to the plaintiff in the attachment suit or action must also be proved. Sears v. Lydon, 5 Idaho 358, 49 P. 122 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no presumption in favor of the proceedings of a court of general jurisdiction unless the court is proceeding according to the course of common law. There is no presumption indulged when a court of general jurisdiction is exercising a statutory power; therefore, no presumption indulged in favor of the validity of proceedings in divorce actions since they are purely statutory and were unknown to the common law.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Where there is more than one (1) judge in any district, the jurisdiction of the respective judges of said district shall be equal and coextensive with the boundaries of the district. In each judicial district there shall be an administrative judge elected by a majority of the district judges within the district to serve for a period of time as provided by rules of the Idaho supreme court. In the event a majority of the district judges cannot agree as to who shall be the administrative judge, then the appointment of the administrative judge shall be by a majority of the Idaho supreme court justices for a period of time as provided by rules of the Idaho supreme court. The administrative judge is hereby granted all powers and duties heretofore or hereafter granted to the senior district judge, and the administrative judge shall apportion the business of such district among such judges as equally as may be, but any judge shall have full power to hold terms of court, transact judicial business, make orders, grant or refuse writs and generally exercise all the powers of a district judge without the concurrence of the other judge or judges. The administrative judge shall receive an annual salary in an amount of three thousand dollars ($3,000) greater than the annual salary of a district judge to compensate for the additional duties of the office.

        Where a district judge from one district holds court in another district and no question is raised as to his authority, it will be presumed, unless the record discloses to the contrary, that he was lawfully exercising jurisdiction; such jurisdiction is exercised under color of authority and is not open to collateral attack. Ex parte Allen, 31 Idaho 295, 170 P. 921 (1918). See also Kettenbach v. Walker, 32 Idaho 544, 186 P. 912 (1919).

        In an action appointing a receiver ex parte in the second judicial district, the judge was temporarily unable to act; therefore, the judge of the tenth judicial circuit was requested to serve. The matter was presented to such judge, and he had jurisdiction in the appointment of a receiver ex parte. Murphy v. McCarty, 69 Idaho 193, 204 P.2d 1014 (1949).

        The district court had jurisdiction to appoint trustees and receivers for foreign corporation which owned valuable property in the state and was making contracts and carrying on business in the state when such corporation became insolvent, had creditors and was unable to pay the debts of the corporation since there is no question that such corporation can be sued in the courts of the state and the courts acquire jurisdiction by reason of the fact that such corporation has appointed an agent and a principal place of business located in the state. Rowe v. Stevens, 25 Idaho 237, 137 P. 159 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        A district court has jurisdiction of actions to quiet title to land or to construe and determine rights under a contract to convey, even though the mental capacity of one or more of the parties is drawn in question. Whitney v. Randall, 58 Idaho 49, 70 P.2d 384 (1937).

        Idaho court had jurisdiction to determine whether corporate stock was in custody of Washington probate court or had been distributed to Idaho litigants and its judgment was unassailable collaterally. Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., 99 F.2d 651 (9th Cir. 1938), aff’d, 308 U.S. 66, 60 S. Ct. 44, 84 L. Ed. 85 (1939), rehearing denied, 309 U.S. 693, 60 S. Ct. 464, 84 L. Ed. 1034 (1940).

        District court had jurisdiction to determine custody of minor child whose parents had been divorced in a county other than that in which complaint for custody had been filed, where plaintiff was a resident of the state and personal service had been obtained against defendant within jurisdiction of court, since statutes governing custody of children had not limited original jurisdiction of district court in cases both at law and equity granted by<cite class="id_code">Idaho Const., Art.

    District court had jurisdiction of proceeding by taxpayer to contest result of election to determine whether county commissioners should issue bonds to build a hospital based on contention that non-taxpayers were permitted to vote, regardless of whether suit was in equity or in law. Henley v. Elmore County, 72 Idaho 374, 242 P.2d 855 (1952).

        The district court in exercising its appellate jurisdiction in probate matters is limited to deciding the issue previously tried in the probate court and presented by the appeal. Muncey v. Children’s Home Finding & Aid Soc’y, 84 Idaho 147, 369 P.2d 586 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a purported stipulation included minutes which attempted to resolve issues not as yet presented to the probate court nor embraced within the scope of the question presented on the appeal to the district court, i.e., whether the probate court erred in admitting the will to probate, the order of the trial court must be reversed and the appeal reinstated. Muncey v. Children’s Home Finding & Aid Soc’y, 84 Idaho 147, 369 P.2d 586 (1962).

        District courts have jurisdiction to quiet title in actions resulting from adverse claims filed in federal patent proceedings. Lewiston Lime Co. v. Barney, 87 Idaho 462, 394 P.2d 323 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        In habeas corpus proceeding in federal district court where state prisoners had filed motions for new trial subsequent to conviction and had appealed to state supreme court where convictions were affirmed and prisoners had not exhausted the remedy of habeas corpus to the state district court, federal court assumed jurisdiction to determine petitions raising only the issues previously presented to the state district and supreme courts on the basis that there had been a practical exhaustion of state remedies and a different result appeared unlikely in the state courts. Drapeau v. May, 350 F. Supp. 1321 (D. Idaho 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the subject matter of an action involved alleged proposed unlawful action on the part of the director of insurance which allegedly would cause an insurer irreparable harm, and resolution of the issues raised by the complaint required construction of applicable statutes and determination of the legal effect of a prior administrative decision and order and a prior order of a court of a sister state, the claims presented by the insurer in the district court action involved issues which could be appropriately determined in a declaratory judgment action. Sierra Life Ins. Co. v. Granata, 99 Idaho 624, 586 P.2d 1068 (1978).

        The district court had jurisdiction of the surviving spouse’s action to establish ownership of a one-half interest in the airplane jointly owned by the decedent and the defendant and to force a sale of the airplane. Olson v. Kirkham, 111 Idaho 34, 720 P.2d 217 (Ct. App. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court acquired subject matter jurisdiction over defendant when the state filed the criminal complaint, and although the district court erred in believing it had a valid warrant for defendant’s arrest in that no warrant had been issued on April 25, 1994, or at any time thereafter, the district court had no intention of relinquishing jurisdiction and postponed sentence for a proper purpose, to have defendant in custody or amenable to the process of the court. State v. Rogers, 140 Idaho 223, 91 P.3d 1127 (2004).

        Where an Idaho district court, in passing on the right to stock under a trust agreement, determined that a court in another state did not have jurisdiction to decide the question of the right to the stock, such a holding necessarily determined a question as to the Idaho court’s jurisdiction so as to preclude relitigation thereof in another suit or action either in the state or federal court. Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., 308 U.S. 66, 60 S. Ct. 44, 84 L. Ed. 85 (1939), rehearing denied, 309 U.S. 693, 60 S. Ct. 464, 84 L. Ed. 1034 (1940). Retention of Jurisdiction Exercised.

        Where the district court has obtained jurisdiction of an action on a contract, its jurisdiction extends to all issues arising out of or connected with the contract, or relating to or depending upon it, and the defendant may file his cross-complaint, if necessary, to have such issues adjudicated. Murphy v. Russell, 8 Idaho 151, 67 P. 427 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order denying defendant’s motion for reduction of sentence was upheld where defendant presented no new or additional evidence in support of the motion. The trial court acted within a reasonable time in ruling on the motion and had not lost original jurisdiction when it issued the order denying the motion. State v. Shumway, 144 Idaho 580, 165 P.3d 294 (Ct. App. 2007).

    The absence from the record of five or six pages of testimony due to a temporary mechanical failure of the tape recorder being used to record testimony did not invalidate the proceedings of the trial in the absence of a showing by the appellant that proceedings prejudicial to appellant transpired during the period of which no record was made.

        Requiring every discussion held between the parties and their counsel or interpreter to be transcribed by a necessarily bilingual court reporter would be impracticable and would unduly interfere with well-established court procedures. Gonzales v. State, 120 Idaho 759, 819 P.2d 1159 (Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tradition and common sense dictates that “proceedings,” when used to define what a court should require as part of the transcript, means the conversations between the judge and the parties, their counsel or their interpreter; therefore, neither this section nor Idaho R. Crim. P. 12(g) require transcription of the conversations held at the defense table between the defendant and the interpreter or the defendant and his attorney because these discussions usually are spoken “sotto voce” and are not intended as communications for the court. Gonzales v. State, 120 Idaho 759, 819 P.2d 1159 (Ct. App. 1991).

        Since the requirement that the reporter correctly report all oral proceedings and testimony is mandatory, a party has no obligation to request a recording nor must he object to a local practice of not recording all proceedings, and it is only on counsel’s waiver with consent of the judge that the mandatory requirements may be waived.

        Where a voir dire of potential jurors was held in the judge’s chambers to determine whether jurors had viewed or heard about defendant wearing handcuffs as he entered the courtroom, and where the transcript of the official court reporter contained the questions asked, but not the jurors’ responses thereto, the defendant could not complain of the failure to include the responses in light of the fact that the record on appeal contained no motion for an addition to the reporter’s transcript to include the responses of the jurors.

        Action of the Judge on Misconduct of Others.
       </h5>
       <p>
        It is within the power of the judge to administer an admonition or deliver a rebuke to a counsel, party, bystander, or witness for misconduct or improprieties, and the course of the judge therein rests largely in his sound discretion. It is a dangerous practice to order the arrest of a witness or party for perjury during the trial and in the presence of the jury, as it will generally work a reversal. So, too, the trial judge should be careful even in administering a rebuke and not permit it to take on the aspect of severity; the danger of such rebuke is that it might prejudice the jury against the party who had called the witness. State v. Clark, 27 Idaho 48, 146 P. 1107 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        An assignment claiming prejudicial error for an outcry, “You lie!” by the wife of the complaining witness, while accused was testifying, was held not reviewable, where no request was made to have the jury instructed relative to the incident, nor to have the wife reprimanded, and no exception was taken. State v. Cox, 55 Idaho 694, 46 P.2d 1093 (1935).

        Administrative Judge as Judicial Officer.
       </h5>
       <p>
        Section 1-907, which lists the powers and duties of an administrative judge, does not include contempt powers. However, this section provides that “[e]very court has power: . . . [t]o compel obedience to its . . . orders . . . ,” and<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.01.html#t01c19s1-1901" target="_blank">§ 1-1901 </a></cite>equips each “judicial officer” with similar powers; although there is no case law as to whether an administrative judge is classified as a judicial officer, it is reasonable to assume that he is.

        This section does not authorize a motion for a new trial in the supreme court in an original proceeding instituted in and disposed of by that court. People ex rel. Lincoln County v. George, 3 Idaho 108, 27 P. 680 (1891).

        Where the probate court, by inadvertence, confirms a sale of real estate to the wrong person, it may subsequently vacate the order of confirmance and enter a proper order. State ex rel. Chemung Mining Co. v. Cunningham, 6 Idaho 113, 53 P. 451 (1898).

        Trial court in granting a rehearing on a prior order must protect legitimate rights acquired under the prior order. J.I. Case Co. v. McDonald, 76 Idaho 223, 280 P.2d 1070 (1955).

        The court may order a defective summons so amended as to conform to the requirements of the statute and, after amendment, may order it withdrawn from the files and served. Ridenbaugh v.

        While title 7, chapter 6, Code, provides statutory guidance with respect to contempts, it may not constitutionally circumscribe the judicial power conferred by Const., Art. V, § 2, the power recognized by this section or the inherent common-law contempt power. Marks v. Vehlow, 105 Idaho 560, 671 P.2d 473 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 7-611, governing contempt by omission, does not preclude alternative civil sanctions under the common law or this section; in such instances, the coercive force may be implemented by means of prospective conditional fines. Marks v. Vehlow, 105 Idaho 560, 671 P.2d 473 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the primary purpose of the contempt order against defendant, entered after she pled guilty to driving under the influence, was to coerce compliance with the court’s order, the contempt order was a civil contempt order and no statute of limitations applied. State v. Schorzman, 129 Idaho 313, 924 P.2d 214 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bail bondsman’s contractual obligation to pay forfeited bond was a civil liability enforceable by the prosecuting attorney in a separate civil action, and district court was without authority to enforce payment of the bond forfeiture under the penalty of contempt. State v. Rocha, 131 Idaho 113, 952 P.2d 1249 (Ct. App. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Warrants of attachment arise from the contempt power of the court. State v. Hall, 132 Idaho 751, 979 P.2d 624 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a dispute over an access easement, the district court did not abuse its discretion by entering an injunction against appellant for contempt because the district court simply ordered the parties to continue abiding by the terms of the stipulated judgment — terms to which they were already bound. That action clearly fell within the judge’s authority to compel obedience. Steiner v. Gilbert, 144 Idaho 240, 159 P.3d 877 (2007).

        A district judge who was also serving as an administrative district judge was cloaked in absolute judicial immunity from liability when he jailed a clerk and deputy clerk of court pursuant to a contempt order even though the judge was not in chambers nor were the parties involved in an adversary proceeding; jurisdiction is construed broadly where the issue is the immunity of a judge.

       <p>
        A district court’s imposition of a “lien” upon a mining partnership’s machinery and claims in order to secure the costs of preparing a land restoration plan and contingent restoration costs was an action which, in effect, replaced the security ordinarily assured by the statutory bond required by<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.47.html#t47c13s47-1317" target="_blank">§ 47-1317 </a></cite>and was within the inherent power of the court under this section to insure compliance not only with the intent of the statute but also with its own related orders. State ex rel. Evans v. Click, 102 Idaho 443, 631 P.2d 614 (1981), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1116, 102 S. Ct. 2927, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1328 (1982).

       <p>
        The post-judgment imposition of a “lien” to ensure compliance with a court’s order is within the inherent power of the court to insure compliance with not only the intent of this section, but also its own related orders. When the matter has been appealed, the “lien” may be upheld under Idaho R. Civ. P. 65(e)(3), which grants the court power to grant, suspend or modify an injunction during the pendency of an appeal, upon imposition of sufficient security through bonds or other means to preserve the subject matter of the litigation and the rights of the parties.

        This section, which requires the court to adopt any suitable process or mode of process which appears most comfortable to the spirit of the code, is not applicable to permit the court to establish the procedure for adult adoption, for this is an area which is entirely statutory and should be established by the legislature.

        Where the court had jurisdiction of both the parties and the subject matter, an order authorizing the withholding of payments to divorced wife under an alimony contract made part of the decree of divorce was not void for want of jurisdiction, however irregular or erroneous such order might be. McDonald v. McDonald, 55 Idaho 102, 39 P.2d 293 (1934).

       <p>
        The district court, upon the reversal of a judgment on appeal from a probate or justice’s court on question of law alone, where no issue of fact was tendered in the lower court, should remand the cause with instructions to proceed in accordance with the decision and judgment of the district court.

        A district judge who was also serving as an administrative district judge was cloaked in absolute judicial immunity from liability when he jailed a clerk and deputy clerk of court pursuant to a contempt order even though the judge was not in chambers nor were the parties involved in an adversary proceeding; jurisdiction is construed broadly where the issue is the immunity of a judge.

       </h5>
       <p>
        A district judge who was also serving as an administrative district judge was cloaked in absolute judicial immunity from liability when he jailed a clerk and deputy clerk of court pursuant to a contempt order even though the judge was not in chambers nor were the parties involved in an adversary proceeding; jurisdiction is construed broadly where the issue is the immunity of a judge. Crooks v. Maynard, 913 F.2d 699 (9th Cir. 1990).

       A justice or judge who leaves office or retires from the supreme court, court of appeals or a district court, except a justice or judge retired under the provisions of section 1-2001(4), Idaho Code, may be designated a senior judge of the state of Idaho by the supreme court.

       Upon filing with the secretary of state an oath of office as a senior judge as prescribed in subsection (7) of this section, a senior judge is eligible for temporary assignment by the supreme court to a state court as provided in this subsection, whenever the supreme court determines that the assignment is reasonably necessary and will promote the more efficient administration of justice. A senior judge may sit as a district or magistrate judge of the district court of any county or may sit with the supreme court or court of appeals or may perform such other duties pertaining to the judicial department of government as may be requested.

       The assignment of a senior judge shall be made by an order which shall designate the court or duties to which the judge is assigned and the duration of the assignment. Promptly after assignment of a senior judge under this section, the supreme court shall cause a certified copy of the order to be sent to the senior judge and another certified copy to the court to which the judge is assigned.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c20s1-2005ol14">

       A senior judge assigned as provided in this section, other than one performing services required by section 1-2001(2)(b), Idaho Code, shall receive as compensation for each day the senior judge is actually engaged in the performance of duties under the assignment an amount equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of the daily salary of the highest office in which the senior judge served. However, a retired judge shall not receive for services as a senior judge during any fiscal year a sum of money which when added to the amount of any judicial retirement pay received by the senior judge for the year exceeds the current annual salary of the highest office in which the senior judge served; except that this limitation shall not apply if the chief justice of the supreme court determines that extended service by one (1) or more senior judges is required because of extraordinary circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a judge’s absence from service due to military service or medical disability. Services by a senior judge under an assignment and receipt of compensation for services shall not reduce or otherwise affect the amount of any retirement pay to which the senior judge otherwise would be entitled. Such additional compensation above the retirement compensation benefits accruing to such senior judge shall be paid from the general fund in accordance with appropriations provided by the legislature.

       A senior judge assigned to a court located outside the county in which the senior judge regularly resides shall receive, in addition to any daily compensation, reimbursement for traveling and subsistence expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of duties under the assignment. The expenses shall be paid upon presentation of an itemized statement of the expenses, certified by the senior judge to be correct.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c20s1-2005ol17">
       To be eligible for assignment, a senior judge must: maintain a residence within the state; comply with all applicable provisions of the Idaho code of judicial conduct; and take, subscribe and file with the secretary of state, the following oath or affirmation:“I, ..............., do solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that as a senior judge of the state of Idaho, I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Idaho, and that upon hereafter accepting any assignment to serve as a judge of a court of this state I will faithfully discharge the duties thereof to the best of my ability.”.

       Except as provided in section 1-2001(2)(b), Idaho Code, any period of service rendered by a senior judge shall not in any way be computed for additional retirement benefits, and the state controller shall not receive or deduct any sum for transfer to the judges’ retirement fund or to the public employee retirement system of Idaho.

        Court properly denied a debtor’s Idaho R. Civ. P. 40(d)(1) disqualification motion in creditors’ quiet title action, because senior judges appointed under this section were excepted from Rule 40(d)(1) motions to disqualify without cause, and a nunc pro tunc order retroactively and properly assigned the judge to the case. Merrill v. Gibson, 139 Idaho 840, 87 P.3d 949, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 926, 125 S. Ct. 311, 160 L. Ed. 2d 225 (2004).

       </p>
       <p>
        “I, ..............., do solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that as a senior judge of the state of Idaho, I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Idaho, and that upon hereafter accepting any assignment to serve as a judge of a court of this state I will faithfully discharge the duties thereof to the best of my ability.”.
       </p>
       <p>
        (8) Except as provided in section 1-2001(2)(b), Idaho Code, any period of service rendered by a senior judge shall not in any way be computed for additional retirement benefits, and the state controller shall not receive or deduct any sum for transfer to the judges’ retirement fund or to the public employee retirement system of Idaho.

      § 1-2103. Removal, disciplining, or retirement of judges or justices — Procedure.
     </h3>
     <p>
      A justice of the Supreme Court or judge of any district court, in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section, may be disciplined or removed for wilful misconduct in office or wilful and persistent failure to perform his duties or habitual intemperance or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings judicial office into disrepute, or he may be retired for disability seriously interfering with the performance of his duties, which is, or is likely to become of a permanent character. The judicial council may, after such investigation as the council deems necessary, order a hearing to be held before it concerning the removal, discipline or retirement of a justice or a judge, or the council may in its discretion request the Supreme Court to appoint three (3) special masters, who shall be justices or judges, to hear and take evidence in any such matters, and to report their findings to the council. If, after hearing, or after considering the record and the findings and report of the masters, the council finds good cause therefor, it shall recommend to the Supreme Court the removal, discipline or retirement, as the case may be, of the justice or judge.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Supreme Court shall review the record of the proceedings on the law and facts and in its discretion may permit the introduction of additional evidence and shall order removal, discipline or retirement, as it finds just and proper, or wholly reject the recommendation. Upon an order for retirement, the justice or judge shall thereby be retired with the same rights and privileges as if he retired pursuant to other provisions of law. Upon an order for removal, the justice or judge shall thereby be removed from office, and his salary shall cease from the date of such order.
     </p>
     <p>
      All papers filed with and the proceedings before the judicial council or masters appointed by the Supreme Court, pursuant to this section, shall be subject to disclosure according to chapter 1, title 74, Idaho Code, provided, however, that if allegations against a judge are made public by the complainant, judge or third persons, the judicial council may, in its discretion, comment on the existence, nature, and status of any investigation. The filing of papers with and the giving of testimony before the council or the masters shall be privileged; but no other publication of such papers or proceedings shall be privileged in any action for defamation except that (a) the record filed by the council in the Supreme Court continues privileged and upon such filing loses its confidential character and (b) a writing which was privileged prior to its filing with the council or the masters does not lose such privilege by such filing. The judicial council shall by rule provide for procedures under this section, including the exercise of requisite process and subpoena powers. A justice or judge who is a member of the council or Supreme Court shall not participate in any proceedings involving his own removal, discipline or retirement.

      A magistrate of the district court, in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this section, may be disciplined or removed for wilful misconduct in office or wilful and persistent failure to perform his duties or habitual intemperance or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings judicial office into disrepute, or he may be recommended for retirement for disability seriously interfering with the performance of his duties, which is, or is likely to become of a permanent character.
     </p>
     <p>
      The judicial council may, after such investigation as the council deems necessary, order a hearing to be held before it concerning the removal, discipline or retirement of a magistrate, or the council may in its discretion request the Supreme Court to appoint three (3) special masters, who shall be district judges or district magistrates, to hear and take evidence in any such matters, and to report their findings to the council. If, after hearing, or after considering the record and the findings and report of the masters, the council finds good cause therefor, it shall recommend to the Supreme Court the removal, discipline or retirement, as the case may be, of the magistrate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Supreme Court shall review the record of the proceedings on the law and facts and in its discretion may permit the introduction of additional evidence and shall order removal or discipline, or recommend retirement for disability, or wholly reject the recommendation. Upon a recommendation for retirement for disability, the recommendation shall be presented to the public employee retirement system for action. Upon an order for removal, the magistrate shall thereby be removed from office, and his salary shall cease from the date of such order.
     </p>
     <p>
      All papers filed with and the proceedings before the judicial council, or masters appointed by the Supreme Court, pursuant to this section, shall be confidential; provided, however, that if allegations against a magistrate are made public by the complainant, the magistrate, or third person, the judicial council may, in its discretion, comment on the existence, nature and status of any investigation. The filing of papers with and the giving of testimony before the council or the masters shall be privileged, but no other publication of such papers or proceedings shall be privileged in any action for defamation except that (a) the record filed by the council in the Supreme Court continues privileged and upon such filing loses its confidential character; and (b) a writing which was privileged prior to its filing with the council or the masters does not lose such privilege by such filing. The judicial council shall by rule provide for procedures under the provisions of this section including the exercise of requisite process and subpoena powers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The provisions of this section are alternative to, and cumulative with, the removal of magistrates by impeachment, and the original supervisory control of members of the judicial system by the Supreme Court.

        The magistrate court erred in summarily terminating a driver’s license suspension proceeding and returning the license to a driver on the ground that the court did not have jurisdiction to proceed on the basis of fact that the affidavit filed by the officer was invalid; with both jurisdiction over the subject matter and personal jurisdiction over the parties, the magistrate court erred when it concluded that “the court does not have jurisdiction to proceed.” Hanson v.

        An attorney magistrate is a judicial officer of the district court whose jurisdiction is established by legislation, under the Idaho constitution, by rule of the Idaho supreme court, and by the rules of the respective district courts. Marks v. Vehlow, 105 Idaho 560, 671 P.2d 473 (1983).

        The magistrate court erred in summarily terminating a driver’s license suspension proceeding and returning the license to a driver on the ground that the court did not have jurisdiction to proceed on the basis of fact that the affidavit filed by the officer was invalid; with both jurisdiction over the subject matter and personal jurisdiction over the parties, the magistrate court erred when it concluded that “the court does not have jurisdiction to proceed.” Hanson v.

        Idaho R. Civ. P. 82(c)(1) and 82(c)(2) create independent grounds for magistrate jurisdiction — one based upon subject matter and the other based upon the amount in controversy. Clearly the $10,000 value limit of paragraph (A) of Idaho R. Civ. P. 82(c)(2) does not apply to the separate conferral upon magistrates of jurisdiction for probate and estate administration proceedings under paragraph (A) of Idaho R. Civ. P. 82(c)(1) and subsection (2) of this section. Keeven v. Estate of Keeven, 126 Idaho 290, 882 P.2d 457 (Ct. App. 1994).

        Trial court and the parties mistakenly believed that the contract establishing the survivor’s estate contained provisions relating to the determination of the beneficiary’s entitlement, and because there was confusion regarding what expenses, particularly attorney fees, could be deducted from his share, the judge handling the probate was best positioned to determine the net share of any estate beneficiary, considering all expenses, the overall scheme of distribution, and the effect of one beneficiary’s entitlement upon that of the others; by following the intent of the applicable statutes and rules pertaining to assignment of probate proceedings to the magistrate division, confusion could be averted or alleviated.

        Since by virtue of this section and Idaho R. Civ. P. 82(c)(2) and a rule of the third judicial circuit, lawyer magistrates had subject matter jurisdiction in divorce action, where after holding a hearing on the matter he found that a common-law marriage existed and ordered defendant to pay alimony pendente lite and attorney fees, district court erred in issuing writ of prohibition forbidding any further action by the magistrate in the proceedings.

        If an attorney magistrate is properly assigned a particular proceeding, he is necessarily assigned all ancillary proceedings incident to the underlying proceeding, regardless of the dollar amount of the controversy involved in the ancillary matters; thus, the assignment of the divorce proceeding to the presiding attorney magistrate carried with it the assignment of all ancillary proceedings to that divorce, including accountings between the parties, arising out of or related to the divorce proceedings.

       </p>
       <p>
        The district court erred in affirming magistrate’s decision where magistrate ignored portions of testimony and failed to make specific findings of fact in arriving at his order. In re Estate of Stibor, 96 Idaho 162, 525 P.2d 357 (1974).

        Where the district court reviewed on the record the decision of the magistrate that a parent-child relationship should be terminated because the father abandoned the child, it was bound by standards of appellate review to determine the factual sufficiency of the record to sustain the magistrate’s finding, and it was error for the district court to substitute its evaluation of the evidence for that of the magistrate.

       <p>
        Where the magistrate judge convicted defendant of misdemeanor domestic battery, the district court ruled that the magistrate erred by applying the beyond a reasonable doubt standard to defendant’s self-defense claim. The district court, acting its in appellate capacity, had the discretion to remand the case to the magistrate to reconsider the testimony applying the correct burden of proof without ordering a new trial.

        Where original magistrate fell ill following first day of testimony by state on termination of parental rights and second magistrate, hearing case by stipulation of both parties, heard only testimony on behalf of mother, district court’s failure to hear case as trial de novo instead of reviewing case as appeal from magistrate level was not error, since counsel of record had implied authority to enter into stipulation and agreements respecting matters of procedure.

        Where the only issue on appeal was the sufficiency of the evidence, the district court’s refusal to observe a video tape taken of defendant several hours after his arrest for driving while under the influence of intoxicating beverages, but electing instead to consider defendant’s appeal on the basis of the record made in the magistrates division, was not reversible error, since there was other substantial and competent evidence to sustain the judgment of conviction.

       <p>
        Where the magistrate’s findings of fact are confused or in conflict, or where findings on a particular issue are lacking, and resort to the record does not show clearly what findings are correct, the district court ordinarily will not modify the judgment, but will either remand for new findings or, alternatively, conduct a partial or whole trial de novo. Hawkins v. Hawkins, 99 Idaho 785, 589 P.2d 532 (1978).
    The district court, having undertaken the task of conducting an appellate review, is not, as a result, precluded from conducting a trial de novo; when circumstances prevent a decisive, complete, or meaningful appellate review, it may be advisable for the district court to augment the trial record or create a new record in order to completely resolve the controversy. Winn v. Winn, 101 Idaho 270, 611 P.2d 1055 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court may conduct an appellate review of a magistrate’s decision just as the supreme court would conduct a review of a district court decision, or the district court may choose to wipe the slate clean by ordering a trial de novo and beginning the case anew. Winn v. Winn, 101 Idaho 270, 611 P.2d 1055 (1980).

        District court did not err when it ordered a trial de novo after having heard appellate argument, but before issuing an appellate decision. Latham Motors, Inc. v. Phillips, 123 Idaho 689, 851 P.2d 985 (Ct. App. 1993).

        Although a proceeding brought by a city to set aside an order issued pursuant to this section, which obligated the city to provide facilities for a magistrate division of the district court, was not truly a civil action, the district judges have an inherent power, codified in<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.01.html#t01c16s1-1622" target="_blank">§ 1-1622</a></cite>, to consider the standards in Idaho R. Civ. P. 24(a) and allow a county which would be adversely affected by the set aside, to intervene. City of Boise v. Ada County (In re Facilities &amp; Equip. Provided by the City of Boise), 147 Idaho 794, 215 P.3d 514 (2009).
    When cities were ordered to contribute to the costs of facilities for the magistrate’s division of the district court, but were not assessed any specific amount of support, the cities’ appeal of that order did not present a justiciable controversy because nothing showed the cities suffered any harm, as (1) the cities had not been required to pay anything, and (2) there was no plan regarding what the cities had to do to comply with the order.

        City did not meet its burden to show good and sufficient cause for setting aside an order under this section from 1980, requiring the city to provide facilities for a magistrate division of the district court. While
    Twin Falls County v. Cities of Twin Falls and Filer
    , 143 Idaho 398, 146 P.3d 664 (2006), precluded the district judges from ordering a city to reimburse a county for use of county-owned facilities, the decision did not absolve the city of its responsibilities under the order. Additionally, the construction of a new county courthouse and the fact that the city voluntarily transferred its rights to all fees collected under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.31.html#t31c32s31-3201A" target="_blank">§ 31-3201A</a></cite> to the county did not relieve the city of its responsibilities under the order.

     <p>
      Any magistrate appointed pursuant to the provisions of section 1-2205, Idaho Code, and section 1-2207(2), Idaho Code, shall stand for office in the first general election next succeeding the expiration of the eighteen (18) month period established pursuant to section 1-2207, Idaho Code. Any magistrate may, not less than ninety (90) days prior to the holding of the general election next preceding the expiration of his term of office, file in the office of the county clerk of the county for which he is a resident magistrate, accompanied by a filing fee of forty dollars ($40.00), a declaration of candidacy to succeed himself. If a declaration is not so filed by any magistrate, the vacancy resulting from the expiration of his term of office shall be filled by appointment as herein provided, except that any magistrate who does not file shall be ineligible for appointment within the same judicial district until two (2) years following the expiration of his last term of office have expired. If such a declaration is filed, his name shall be submitted at the next general election to the voters eligible to vote within the county for which he is appointed, on a nonpartisan judicial ballot, without party designation, which shall read:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Shall Magistrate . . . . (Here insert the name of the magistrate) of . . . . (Here insert the name of the county) County of the . . . . (Here insert the judicial district number) Judicial District be retained in office?” (Here provision is to be made for voting “Yes” or “No.”)
     </p>
     <p>
      The votes shall be canvassed as provided in chapter 12, title 34, Idaho Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a majority of those voting on the question vote against retaining him in office, upon the expiration of his term of office, a vacancy shall exist which shall be filled by appointment as provided in section 1-2205, Idaho Code, except that the magistrate not retained in office shall be ineligible for appointment within the same judicial district until two (2) years following the expiration of his last term of office have expired.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a majority of those voting on the question vote for retaining him in office, the county clerk shall issue him a certificate of election as provided in section 34-1209, Idaho Code, and said magistrate shall, unless removed for cause, remain in office for an additional term of four (4) years, and at the expiration of each such four (4) year term shall be eligible for retention in office by election in the manner herein prescribed.

     <ol>
      <li id="t01c22s1-2221ol11">
       A magistrate judge who leaves office or retires from the magistrates division of a district court, except a magistrate judge retired under the provisions of section 59-1352, Idaho Code, may be designated a senior judge of the state of Idaho by the supreme court.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c22s1-2221ol12">
       Upon filing with the secretary of state an oath of office as a senior judge as prescribed in subsection (7) of this section, a senior judge is eligible for temporary assignment, with the consent of the senior judge, by the supreme court to a state court as provided in this subsection, whenever the supreme court determines that the assignment is reasonably necessary and will promote the more efficient administration of justice. A senior judge may sit as a judge of the district court of any county or may sit with the supreme court or court of appeals or may perform such other duties pertaining to the judicial department of government as may be requested.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c22s1-2221ol13">
       The assignment of a senior judge shall be made by an order which shall designate the court or duties to which the senior judge is assigned and the duration of the assignment. Promptly after assignment of a senior judge under this section, the supreme court shall cause a certified copy of the order to be sent to the senior judge and another certified copy to the court to which the senior judge is assigned.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c22s1-2221ol14">
       Each senior judge assigned as provided in this section has all the judicial powers and duties, while serving under the assignment, of a regularly qualified judge of the court to which the senior judge is assigned.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c22s1-2221ol15">
       A senior judge assigned as provided in this section shall receive as compensation for each day the senior judge is actually engaged in the performance of duties under the assignment an amount equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of the daily salary of an active magistrate judge. However, a retired magistrate judge shall not receive for services as a senior judge during any fiscal year a sum of money which when added to the amount of any judicial retirement pay received by the senior judge for the year exceeds the current annual salary of an active magistrate judge; except that this limitation shall not apply if the chief justice of the supreme court determines that extended service by one (1) or more senior judges is required because of extraordinary circumstances, such as a natural disaster or a judge’s absence from service due to military service or medical disability. Services by a senior judge under an assignment and receipt of compensation for services shall not reduce or otherwise affect the amount of any retirement pay to which the senior judge otherwise would be entitled. Such additional compensation above the retirement compensation benefits accruing to such senior judge shall be paid from the general fund in accordance with appropriations provided by the legislature.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c22s1-2221ol16">
       A senior judge assigned to a court located outside the county in which the senior judge regularly resides shall receive, in addition to any daily compensation, reimbursement for traveling and subsistence expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of duties under the assignment. The expenses shall be paid upon presentation of an itemized statement of the expenses, certified by the senior judge to be correct.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c22s1-2221ol17">
       To be eligible for assignment, a senior judge must: maintain a residence within the state; comply with all applicable provisions of the Idaho code of judicial conduct; and take, subscribe and file with the secretary of state, the following oath or affirmation:
    “I, ..............., do solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that as a senior judge of the state of Idaho, I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Idaho, and that upon hereafter accepting any assignment to serve as a senior judge of a court of this state I will faithfully discharge the duties thereof to the best of my ability.”.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c22s1-2221ol18">
       Any period of service rendered by a senior judge shall not in any way be computed for additional retirement benefits, and the state controller shall not receive or deduct any sum for transfer to the public employee retirement system of Idaho.

        Debtor was convicted of passing bad checks arising out of a purchase by debtor of cattle from the other party to the transaction. The state criminal court placed debtor on probation and ordered that he pay other party restitution. Several months later debtor and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief. Under applicable state law, other party held a claim against debtor based on the dishonor of the checks independent from any obligation created via the criminal prosecution. Accordingly, the court found that the defendant was a creditor of debtor at the time of its receipt of the restitution payments, and that those payments were avoidable by the bankruptcy trustee under the Bankruptcy Code. Zimmerman v. Itano Farms, Inc. (In re Currey), 144 Bankr. 490 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1992).

        Where defendant admitted to the state court in a prosecution under<cite class="ocid"><a href="idaho.title.18.html#t18c31s18-3106" target="_blank">§ 18-3106 </a></cite>that he delivered checks to plaintiff knowing that he did not have the funds on deposit to cover the checks and that he did so wilfully and with the intent to defraud plaintiff, such findings supported a claim in favor of plaintiff over defendant under this section for the amount of the checks and, in addition supported a finding that the indebtedness created thereby was exempted from defendant’s discharge under the federal Bankruptcy Code. Itano Farms, Inc. v. Currey, 154 Bankr. 977 (Bankr. D. Idaho 1993).

       A creditor cannot threaten a debtor with criminal penalties if the debtor fails to pay a bad check.<cite class="OAG">OAG 84-6</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       A suit under this section precludes imposition of attorneys’ fees, interest on the check for the period before the date of judgment, and collection costs; this section allows recovery only of the amount of the check and treble damages.<cite class="OAG">OAG 84-6</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the drawer pays the check during the required notice time, he can never be obligated to pay more than the face amount; however, under a former section, the notice was posted at the point of sale and the creditor was not required to mail a notice of dishonor. In such a case, the drawer may be obligated to pay the noticed amount of the collection fee.<cite class="OAG">OAG 84-6</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a suit under this section, a judge has discretion to reduce the amount of treble damages if the statutory requirements of suit have been met.<cite class="OAG">OAG 84-6</cite>.
    Since this section is a small claims court remedy, its use is restricted to actions by the owners of checks; however, an owner could sue under this section and then turn the judgment over to a collection agency or attorney for collection.<cite class="OAG">OAG 84-6</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conclusion that the use of this section is limited to small claims court is compelled by evidence that such is the legislative intent as revealed by the legislative history, the desire to avoid harsh results, comparison with other statutes and sections, policy grounds, social and economic consequences, the placement of the statute, its heading, and other principles of statutory construction.<cite class="OAG">OAG 84-6</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section appears designed to give the holder of a dishonored check an incentive to collect on the check himself without having to employ an attorney, thereby allowing the holder to get treble damages in lieu of attorneys’ fees.<cite class="OAG">OAG 84-6</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a creditor has violated provisions of this section or a former section in title 28, a debtor may refuse to pay more than he is obligated to pay and may bring suit to recover any amounts wrongfully collected by a holder.<cite class="OAG">OAG 84-6</cite>.
